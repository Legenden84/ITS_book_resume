# 2.2 Summary of Symmetric-key Encryption and Decryption

## Symmetric-key Algorithms
Two principal categories of algorithms exist in cryptography: symmetric-key and asymmetric encryption. Symmetric-key encryption uses identical keys for both encryption and decryption, denoted as $k = k'$ in equations. In contrast, asymmetric encryption utilizes two distinct keys.

### Example: Vernam Cipher (Stream Cipher)
The Vernam cipher, an example of a symmetric-key algorithm and specifically a stream cipher, encrypts messages bit by bit using a key of equal length to the message. The process involves a bitwise exclusive-OR operation. Theoretically, when the key is random and used only once, the Vernam cipher becomes a one-time pad, which is unbreakable. However, practical use is limited due to the challenges in key distribution and management.

#### Example: Integrity Issue in One-Time Pad
To illustrate the lack of integrity in a one-time pad, consider a binary representation of a salary. If the salary is encrypted as `00000001 00000000 00000000` using a one-time pad, changing a single bit in the ciphertext could result in an incorrect decryption, falsely representing the salary. This manipulation demonstrates that a one-time pad, while confidential, cannot protect against data tampering.

## Cipher Attacks in Practice
One-time pads offer perfect security in theory, meaning that decryption without the key is impossible, even with unlimited computational resources. In real-world applications, ciphers only provide computational security and can potentially fail from algorithmic weaknesses or through brute-force attacks if the key space is small. The success of brute-force attacks depends on the attacker's computational power and the ability to identify correct key guesses, often using known plaintext-ciphertext pairs.

## Stream Ciphers
Stream ciphers like the Vernam cipher use a keystream generated from a fixed-size secret key to encrypt plaintext bits through XOR operations. They are advantageous for encrypting data in real-time, such as user-typed characters, because they don't require the plaintext to be a certain length.

## Block Ciphers, Blocklength, and Key Size

Block ciphers represent a core category of symmetric encryption algorithms that process plaintext in fixed-size blocks, applying a key-driven encryption function to each block independently.

### Blocklength
The blocklength is the term used to describe the size of these blocks, typically measured in bits. For example, a block cipher with a blocklength of 128 bits would encrypt data in discrete chunks of 128 bits each. The chosen blocklength is a trade-off between security and performanceâ€”the longer the blocklength, the more secure the encryption can be, but this may also require more processing power and time.

### Key Size
Key size refers to the length of the secret key used for encryption and decryption, also measured in bits. It is a critical security parameter; larger key sizes generally equate to stronger encryption because they increase the number of possible keys, exponentially raising the difficulty for an attacker to perform a brute-force attack to guess the key. Common key sizes in block ciphers might be 128, 192, or 256 bits.

### Padding
When the size of the plaintext data does not perfectly fit the blocklength, padding is used to fill the last block to the required size. The padding scheme must be carefully chosen to ensure that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed upon decryption. A common padding method includes appending a single '1' bit followed by '0' bits until the block is full.

## AES Block Cipher
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the predominant block cipher, resulting from an open competition by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). AES, originally named Rijndael, was developed by KU Leuven researchers.

## ECB Encryption and Modes of Operation
Block ciphers can operate in various modes. Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode is the simplest, where plaintext blocks are independently encrypted. However, it's not recommended for messages over one block in length due to pattern leakage. Modes of operation such as CBC and CTR are preferred as they encrypt blocks in a context-sensitive way, making block encryption dependent on other blocks.

## Block Cipher Mode Examples: CBC, CTR

Block cipher modes of operation adjust the basic block cipher process to securely encrypt data larger than the block size or to provide additional security features. Here are two primary examples:

### Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) Mode
In CBC mode, each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted by the block cipher. The process is as follows:
- An Initialization Vector (IV) is used for the first block, which is random and unique for each encryption session.
- The encryption of the first plaintext block `P[1]` uses the IV:
  `C[1] = Encrypt(Key, P[1] XOR IV)`
- Subsequent plaintext blocks `P[i]` use the previous ciphertext block `C[i-1]`:
  `C[i] = Encrypt(Key, P[i] XOR C[i-1])`
This mode ensures that the same plaintext block yields different ciphertext blocks, thus concealing patterns.

### Counter (CTR) Mode
CTR mode transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher using a counter that changes for every block, thus providing high throughputs suitable for modern communication systems. It proceeds as follows:
- A nonce, or number used once, serves as the initial counter value.
- For each plaintext block `P[i]`, the counter is encrypted and then XORed with the plaintext:
  `C[i] = Encrypt(Key, Counter + i) XOR P[i]`
This mode allows encryption and decryption to be done in parallel, significantly increasing performance, and is not susceptible to propagation errors that CBC mode may suffer from.

Both CBC and CTR offer unique benefits: CBC is well-suited for data requiring integrity and confidentiality, while CTR is optimal for scenarios demanding speed and parallel processing. Each mode enhances the security of electronic data by ensuring that the same input does not produce the same output, thwarting pattern analysis attacks.


## Encryption in Practice
Today, symmetric-key encryption is commonly paired with mechanisms for integrity protection, which is an essential aspect of authenticated encryption. This concept is detailed in further sections, discussing message authentication codes (MACs) and authenticated encryption.

Overall, while the principles of symmetric encryption offer theoretical strength in security, practical applications and modes of operation adapt these principles to meet the demands of real-world usage, balancing the ease of use, security, and integrity.
