# 2.3 Public-key Encryption and Decryption

## Introduction

Public-key encryption introduces a fundamental shift from symmetric-key encryption, utilizing a pair of keys for each participant. Each party possesses a unique pair of keys, comprising a public encryption key (e.g., \( e_B \)) and a private decryption key (e.g., \( d_B \)). The public key is open for distribution, while the private key is closely guarded.

## Key Usage and Encryption Process

To send an encrypted message to Bob, Alice obtains Bob’s public key \( e_B \), parameterizes the public-key encryption algorithm \( E \) with it, and encrypts the plaintext message \( m \) to produce the ciphertext \( c \). Bob can decrypt the received message using his private key \( d_B \) and the corresponding decryption algorithm \( D \).

\[ c = E_{eB}(m); \quad m = D_{dB}(c) \]

## The Significance of Key Integrity

The integrity and authenticity of the public key are crucial. Any compromise could lead to unauthorized access, highlighted by an example where an adversary could replace Bob’s public key with their own, misleading users into encrypting messages intended for Bob but accessible by the adversary.

## Key Distribution: Symmetric vs. Public Key

In symmetric-key encryption, a group of \( n \) users would necessitate \( O(n^2) \) unique keys for secure pairwise communications, an impractical scenario as \( n \) grows. Public-key encryption simplifies this, requiring only \( n \) key pairs for the entire group, with each user needing just one set of keys.

## Encryption and Efficiency

While symmetric-key algorithms outpace public-key counterparts in terms of speed, public-key methods excel in establishing shared secrets between parties. A common practice involves using public-key encryption to establish a shared symmetric key, which is then employed for efficient encryption of extensive data.

## RSA Public-key Encryption: A Technical Overview

RSA, the pioneering public-key encryption method, is discussed with technical specifics. It requires a pair of keys for each user, \( (e_A, d_A) \), and involves complex mathematical operations with large prime numbers. The encryption and decryption processes are detailed, emphasizing the need for big number support and highlighting RSA’s primary utility in key management rather than bulk message encryption.

## Conclusion

This section provides an extensive overview of public-key encryption, elucidating its mechanisms, importance of key integrity, and advantages over symmetric-key encryption in terms of key management. It underscores the efficiency of combining both encryption types for secure and practical communications.
