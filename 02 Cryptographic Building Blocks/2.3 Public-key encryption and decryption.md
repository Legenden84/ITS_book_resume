# 2.3 Public-key Encryption and Decryption

In public-key encryption, distinct key pairs are used, labeled with subscripts indicating ownership. For instance, Bob would have a key pair $(eB, dB)$, where $eB$ is his public encryption key, and $dB$ is his private decryption key, which must remain secret. Public-key encryption enables Alice to send a message $m$ to Bob securely by encrypting it with Bob's public key to produce ciphertext $c$, which Bob then decrypts with his private key.

$c = E_{eB}(m); \quad m = D_{dB}(c)$

## Integrity of Public Key is Important
The integrity and authenticity of a public key are paramount. Unlike secrecy, integrity ensures that the public key is genuinely associated with the claimed owner. If a malicious party substitutes a public key with their own, they could decrypt messages intended for the original owner.

## Key Distribution: Symmetric vs. Public Key
Key management in symmetric encryption becomes complex with a large number of users, requiring $O(n^2)$ keys for $n$ users. Conversely, public-key encryption simplifies this by requiring each user to maintain only a single pair of keys, amounting to $n$ pairs in total. This dramatically reduces complexity and improves manageability.

## Hybrid Encryption
Due to the higher efficiency of symmetric-key algorithms for bulk encryption, hybrid systems are often employed. Public-key encryption is utilized to securely exchange a symmetric session key $k$, which is then used to encrypt the main payload. RSA is commonly used for this purpose, not for encrypting the message itself, but for encrypting the shorter session keys.

## Math Details: RSA Public-Key Encryption
#### Key Generation
- Select two large prime numbers $p$ and $q$.
- Compute $n = p * q$.
- Calculate Euler's totient: $φ(n) = (p−1)(q−1)$.
- Choose an integer $e$ (1 < e < φ(n)) that is coprime with $φ(n)$.
  - Coprime numbers are two numbers that have no common factors other than 1; for example, 8 and 15 are coprime because their only common divisor is 1.
- Determine $d$ where $d * e$ mod $φ(n) = 1$.

The public key is $(e, n)$, and the private key is $(d, n)$.

#### Key Distribution
- The public key $(e, n)$ is shared with others.
- The private key $(d, n)$ is kept secret.

#### Encryption
- A message $m$ is turned into a number smaller than $n$.
- The ciphertext $c$ is calculated as $c = m^e mod n$.

#### Decryption
- The original message $m$ is retrieved from $c$ using the private key as $m = c^d mod n$.

#### Example (Hypothetical Numbers)
- Prime numbers: $p = 61$, $q = 53$.
- Public key: $e = 17$, $n = p * q = 3233$.
- Private key: $d = 2753$.
- Encryption: $m = 123$ becomes $c = 123^17 mod 3233$.
- Decryption: $c = 855$ becomes $m = 855^2753 mod 3233$ which returns $m = 123$.

RSA's robustness comes from the fact that $m^(ed) mod n$ results in $m$, thanks to the modular arithmetic properties.
