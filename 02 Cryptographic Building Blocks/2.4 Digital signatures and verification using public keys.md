# 2.4 Digital Signatures and Verification Using Public Keys

## Overview

Digital signatures are secure tags created using public-key algorithms, ensuring message authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. They function as digital counterparts to handwritten signatures, though their adoption in legal contexts faced challenges. Today, they are predominantly used for authentication.

## Signature Properties

Digital signatures provide:
1. **Data Origin Authentication**: Confirms the message's sender.
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures the message hasn't been altered.
3. **Non-repudiation**: Provides strong evidence that the sender cannot deny.

## Non-repudiation in Practice

While non-repudiation is a critical advantage, it hinges on the private signing key's security. Challenges in ensuring private key protection have slowed the replacement of handwritten signatures with digital signatures in legal documents.

## Public-Key Signature Details

Public-key signatures operate similarly to encryption but with reversed roles for the public and private keys. The sender uses their private key to create a signature, and the receiver uses the sender's public key to verify it. Proper validation ensures message authenticity, but additional measures may be necessary to prevent replay attacks.

## Combining Signing and Encrypting

The document poses an exercise for the reader, asking them to detail the process of both signing and encrypting a message, highlighting the importance of the order of these operations and careful handling of data during these processes.

## Distinct Terminology

There's emphasis on using precise terminology, distinguishing between signature and encryption operations to avoid confusion and potential security vulnerabilities, especially when developers might mistakenly use the same key pair for both functions.

## Signatures in Practice

For efficiency, digital signatures are often used alongside hash functions, with further discussion on this topic promised in the following section.

## Conclusion

This section thoroughly explores digital signatures, emphasizing their importance in authentication, the critical nature of private key security, and the necessity for clear and distinct terminology and practices in their implementation.
