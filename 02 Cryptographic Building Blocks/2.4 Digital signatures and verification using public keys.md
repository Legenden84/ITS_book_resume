# 2.4 Digital Signatures and Verification Using Public Keys
Digital signatures are digital equivalents of handwritten signatures but offer enhanced security features. They rely on public-key algorithms to produce a unique bitstring tag which authenticates the origin of a message. This tag results from a combination of the message content and a sender-specific private key. The corresponding public key allows anyone to verify the authenticity of the message, confirming it was indeed sent by the holder of the private key.

### Signature Properties
Three key properties define digital signatures:
1. **Data origin authentication**: It confirms the identity of the message's sender.
2. **Data integrity**: It verifies that the content has not been altered since being signed.
3. **Non-repudiation**: It provides robust evidence that the sender cannot deny the authenticity of the signed data, which is a notable strength over Message Authentication Codes (MACs).

### Non-perudiation in practice
The strength of non-repudiation hinges on the assumption that only the legitimate owner of a private key can use it to sign a message. However, if someone claims that their private key was compromised, this can lead to challenges in the legal and practical acceptance of digital signatures. Ensuring private keys remain secure requires users to employ proper security measures or training, which remains a barrier to the widespread legal adoption of digital signatures.

### Details of public-key signatures
The process of creating a digital signature with public-key methods involves a reversal of the roles played by the keys compared to encryption: the private key is now used for signing. The steps are as follows:
- To sign a message `m`, the sender, Alice, would use her private signing key `sA` to generate a signature `tA` using a signing algorithm `S`, so `tA = SsA(m)`. She then sends both `m` and `tA` to the recipient.
- Upon receiving the message and tag `(m0,t0A)`, any recipient can verify the signature using Alice's public verification key `vA` by applying the verification algorithm `V`. The function `VvA(m0,t0A)` will return `VALID` if the signature is authentic, `INVALID` otherwise.

### Distict terminology for signatures and encryption
It is crucial to distinguish between the terminology used for signatures and encryption. Misuse of terms such as 'encrypting' or 'decrypting' when referring to signing operations creates confusion and potential security vulnerabilities. Signatures and encryption are separate functions and, except for specific cases like RSA, typically require different key pairs to maintain security best practices.

### Digital signatures in practice
Digital signatures in practice often utilize cryptographic hash functions to enhance efficiency:

1. **Hashing**: Instead of signing the whole message, which can be large, the sender first computes its hash, creating a small, fixed-size representation `h = H(m)`.

2. **Signing**: The sender uses their private key to sign the hash, producing a signature `tA = SsA(h)`.

3. **Sending**: The original message `m` and its signature `tA` are sent to the recipient.

4. **Verifying**: Upon receipt, the recipient hashes the message to produce `h'`, then uses the senderâ€™s public key and the signature to verify that `h'` matches the hash value within the signature.

5. **Integrity and Authenticity**: If the hashes match, it confirms the message is intact and authenticates the sender.
