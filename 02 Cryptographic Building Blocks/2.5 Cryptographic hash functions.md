# 2.5 Cryptographic hash functions
Cryptographic hash functions are integral to securing digital data. They transform any binary string into a fixed-length hash value, or digital fingerprint. This output is a compact representation meant to be a unique identifier for the given input. When even one bit of the input is altered, the output should change unpredictably, making it difficult to reverse-engineer or exploit the hash.

### PROPERTIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTIONS
The standard notation for a hash function is `H`. These functions must be computationally simple to execute, while adhering to three core security properties:

- **(H1) One-way property (Preimage resistance)**: For nearly all hash outputs, it should be practically impossible to deduce the original input.
- **(H2) Second-preimage resistance**: It should be infeasible to find a different input that produces the same hash as a given input.
- **(H3) Collision resistance**: Finding two distinct inputs that yield the same hash output should be impractical.

The necessity of these properties varies depending on their application, such as password hashing or digital signatures. H1 is crucial for password protection, while H3 becomes vital when the user can choose the message to be digitally signed.

### COMPUTATIONAL SECURITY
The concept of computational security is anchored in the difficulty of reversing a hash function or finding collisions due to the vast number of possible inputs. With a fixed output size, an astronomical number of inputs could produce the same hash, yet discovering these is computationally infeasible, ensuring security.

### COMMENT ON BLACK MAGIC
The design of functions that meet these properties is complex and should be left to cryptographic experts. Security developers are advised to utilize recommended functions for their specific needs.

### COLLISION-RESISTANT HASH FUNCTIONS
Collision resistance is paramount when the substitution of one input for another could be advantageous to an attacker. Despite H2 offering some security, it does not ensure collision resistance due to the birthday paradox, which illustrates that collisions are more likely than intuitively expected. A hash function with H3 inherently provides H2 and H1, positioning it as the most comprehensive security feature.

#### Example (Hash function as modification detection)
An executable file's hash is computed upon installation and stored securely. Before execution, the OS checks if the file's current hash matches the stored one, ensuring no tampering has occurred. This practice can extend to multiple system files for ongoing integrity verification.

#### Example (One-way functions in password verification)
Passwords are hashed by the server during authentication to avoid storing them in plaintext. This measure protects against internal and external data breaches, as only the hash of the password needs to be stored and compared during the login process.

### BIRTHDAY PARADOX
The birthday paradox helps explain the unexpected efficiency of finding collisions in hash functions. It shows that with a group size of 23, there's a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday. This concept is analogous to hash collisions where the number of possible pairs increases with the input, leading to a higher chance of collision than initially perceived.

### DIGITAL SIGNATURES WITH HASH FUNCTIONS
Digital signatures typically sign a hash of a message instead of the message itself due to efficiency and block size constraints. The hash function used must be collision-resistant to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of the signature.
