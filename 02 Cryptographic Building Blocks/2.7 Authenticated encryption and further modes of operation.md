# 2.7 Authenticated Encryption and Further Modes of Operation

## Overview
This section delves into the combination of message authentication codes (MACs) with symmetric-key encryption, exploring authenticated encryption (AE) and various symmetric-key cipher modes of operation.

## Authenticated Encryption (AE)
AE ensures both confidentiality and data origin authenticity by integrating encryption and MACs. There are two main approaches to AE:
1. **Generic Composition**: Utilizes a block cipher for encryption and a separate MAC algorithm for authentication.
2. **Integrated AE Algorithms**: Preferred for technical reasons, these algorithms safely use a single symmetric key for both encryption and authentication, avoiding the generally discouraged practice of using one crypto key for multiple purposes. Examples can be found in Table 2.2.

## Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)
AEAD is a category of AE algorithms designed to handle scenarios where some data needs to be encrypted and authenticated, while accompanying data needs only to be authenticated, not encrypted. This is common in networking, where packet payloads are encrypted, but header fields are left visible for routing purposes.

### Example Modes of AEAD
- **CCM (Counter mode with CBC-MAC)**: Combines CTR mode for encryption and CBC-MAC for authentication, often using AES as the underlying block cipher. Specific implementation details must be agreed upon for security and interoperability.
- **ChaCha20 and Poly1305**: ChaCha20 is a stream cipher paired with Poly1305, a MAC algorithm, for environments lacking AES hardware support. This pairing is listed as an AEAD algorithm in Table 2.2.

## Implementation and Security Considerations
When implementing AE by combining a block cipher with a MAC algorithm, there are three common approaches:
1. **MAC-Plaintext-Then-Encrypt**: MAC the plaintext, append the MAC tag to the plaintext, and encrypt both.
2. **MAC-Ciphertext-After-Encrypt**: Encrypt the plaintext, MAC the resulting ciphertext, and append the MAC tag.
3. **Encrypt-And-MAC-Plaintext**: Input the plaintext to both the encryption and MAC functions, appending the MAC tag to the ciphertext.

The security of these options is a point of discussion, and the reader is prompted to consider their security implications, with references provided for further exploration.

## Conclusion
This section comprehensively covers the concept of authenticated encryption, detailing its necessity, implementation methods, and specific algorithms that facilitate secure and authenticated communication. The importance of selecting the correct mode of operation for specific use cases is emphasized, along with the potential security considerations of different AE implementation strategies.
