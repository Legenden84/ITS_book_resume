# 2.8 Certificates, Elliptic Curves, and Equivalent Keylengths

## Certificates
Public-key certificates bind a subject to their public key, verified by a Certification Authority (CA) and digitally signed. Relying parties trust the certificate based on their trust in the CA’s public key. 

## Certification Authorities (CA)
CAs play a crucial role in the trust chain, conducting due diligence to verify the subject's identity and their control over the corresponding private key before issuing a certificate.

## Certificate Revocation
Certificates come with a serial number, expiry date, and revocation information to allow early termination of validity in cases like private key compromise. Relying parties can check a certificate’s current validity status.

## NIST-Recommended Keylengths
As of November 2015, NIST recommends at least 112 bits of security strength for U.S. government use in symmetric-key encryption and digital signatures. Security strength is estimated based on resistance to best-known attacks, not just raw bitlength.

## Public-Key Cryptosystems and Security Strength
RSA and Diffie-Hellman (DH) require larger keys than AES for comparable security due to their vulnerability to faster number-theoretic attacks, rather than exhaustive key search.

## Elliptic Curve Public-Key Systems (ECC)
ECC provides computational and storage efficiencies with smaller key sizes, offering a similar functionality to RSA and DH but with different performance trade-offs and complexities. 

## Conclusion
The section covers the fundamentals of certificates, their validation through CAs, and the importance of proper keylengths in ensuring cryptographic security. It also introduces ECC as an efficient alternative to traditional public-key cryptosystems, despite its different trade-offs and complexities.
