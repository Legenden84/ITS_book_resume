# 2.6 Message Authentication and Data Origin Authentication

## Overview

Message authentication is essential in ensuring the integrity of data and confirming the identity of the data's originator, providing a service known as data origin authentication. This process involves the transmission of a special data value or tag, known as a message authentication code (MAC), alongside the actual message. The MAC is generated using a specific algorithm, a MAC function, which is a special type of hash function dependent not only on the input message but also on a secret number (secret key).

## MAC (message authentication code) in Practice: Ensuring Integrity and Authenticity

The MAC function plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the data and verifying the identity of the sender. For instance, if Alice sends Bob a message along with a MAC tag (both sharing the MAC key), Bob can verify the MAC tag to confirm the data’s integrity and authenticate its origin. However, it’s worth noting that since the MAC key is shared, either party could have generated the tag. While Alice and Bob can be certain about each other’s identity in the communication, a third party may not be able to determine the true originator if Alice were to deny sending the message. This highlights a limitation of MACs: they lack the property of non-repudiation.

## MAC DETAILS
A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is pivotal for message integrity and authentication in secure communications. Alice, intending to send a message `m` to Bob, applies a MAC algorithm `M` with a shared key `k`. She computes the MAC tag `t` through the operation `t = Mk(m)` and sends the pair `(m, t)` to Bob. When Bob receives the pair, which may have been altered in transit and is now `(m0, t0)`, he verifies its authenticity by computing `Mk(m0)` and comparing the result to `t0`.

Ensuring message freshness, to prevent replay attacks, is also critical. This means implementing strategies to verify that the message-tag pair `(m0, t0)` Bob receives is unique and not a repetition of a previous legitimate pair.

### MAC Examples
**Block Cipher-Based MAC: CMAC**
CMAC is a technique that utilizes block cipher algorithms to create a MAC. This algorithm's details are outlined in Section 2.9, highlighting its reliance on underlying cipher mechanisms to authenticate messages.

**HMAC with Hash Functions**
HMAC stands out as it leverages hash functions such as SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 for generating the MAC. Depending on the hash function used, it is referred to as HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, etc. 

**Poly1305-AES-MAC and AEAD Combinations**
Further MAC methods include Poly1305-AES-MAC, which combines the Poly1305 algorithm with AES encryption, and various MAC algorithms listed under AEAD schemes in Table 2.2. AEAD schemes ensure that data is encrypted and authenticated in one go, providing a higher security level by bundling confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

### CBC-MAC Example
CBC-MAC emerges from the CBC mode of encryption. For a message `m` composed of blocks `m1, m2, ..., mt` each of n bits (matching the cipher's block size), the MAC key `k` is applied in a sequential process mimicking CBC encryption but with an initial vector (IV) of zero. Only the final block of ciphertext `ct` is preserved and employed as the MAC tag `t`.

#### Detailed Process
1. Initialization: Set an IV of zero.
2. CBC Processing: For each block `mi`:
   - XOR `mi` with the previous ciphertext block (or IV for the first block).
   - Encrypt the result using the block cipher with key `k`.
   - Pass the resulting ciphertext block to the next stage.
3. Finalization: After the last block is processed, take the resulting ciphertext `ct` as the MAC tag `t`.

This MAC is unique to the message due to the chain dependence in CBC: each block's output depends on all preceding blocks. Hence, any change in the message's content would alter the final MAC tag, revealing any tampering attempts.

## Conclusion

In summary, message authentication and data origin authentication are critical services in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital communications. Through the use of MACs, parties can verify the integrity of the received message and authenticate the sender, although limitations such as the lack of non-repudiation need to be considered. The document provides a comprehensive understanding of how MACs work, their practical implementations, and the challenges associated with creating MACs from hash functions, ensuring a robust grasp of the topic.
