# 2.6 Message Authentication and Data Origin Authentication

## Overview

Message authentication is essential in ensuring the integrity of data and confirming the identity of the data's originator, providing a service known as data origin authentication. This process involves the transmission of a special data value or tag, known as a message authentication code (MAC), alongside the actual message. The MAC is generated using a specific algorithm, a MAC function, which is a special type of hash function dependent not only on the input message but also on a secret number (secret key).

## MAC in Practice: Ensuring Integrity and Authenticity

The MAC function plays a crucial role in ensuring the integrity of the data and verifying the identity of the sender. For instance, if Alice sends Bob a message along with a MAC tag (both sharing the MAC key), Bob can verify the MAC tag to confirm the data’s integrity and authenticate its origin. However, it’s worth noting that since the MAC key is shared, either party could have generated the tag. While Alice and Bob can be certain about each other’s identity in the communication, a third party may not be able to determine the true originator if Alice were to deny sending the message. This highlights a limitation of MACs: they lack the property of non-repudiation.

## The Workings of MAC

### Generating and Verifying MAC Tags

To delve deeper into how MACs operate, let’s consider an example where Alice wishes to send a message `m` to Bob, along with a corresponding MAC tag. Using the MAC algorithm `M` and a shared MAC key `k`, Alice computes the tag as `t = Mk(m)` and sends the pair `(m,t)` to Bob. Upon receiving the pair `(m0,t0)` (accounting for any potential alterations during transmission), Bob can verify the integrity and authenticity of the message by computing `Mk(m0)` using his own copy of the key `k` and the received message, and then checking that it matches `t0`.

### Ensuring Freshness

Beyond the basic integrity and authenticity checks, it’s crucial for many applications to ensure the "freshness" of the message, meaning that the received message is not a replay of a previously legitimate message.

## Practical Examples of MAC Algorithms

MAC functions can be implemented using various algorithms, such as:
- CMAC: Based on block ciphers (Section 2.9).
- HMAC: Utilizing a generic hash function `H`, resulting in names like HMAC-H (e.g., with `H` being SHA-1, SHA-2, or SHA-3 variants).
- Poly1305-AES-MAC and others mentioned in AEAD combinations (Table 2.2).

## Constructing MACs from Block Ciphers and Hash Functions

### Example: CBC-MAC

CBC-MAC is a specific example of a MAC algorithm derived from the CBC mode of operation in block ciphers. Without delving into padding details, it showcases how a MAC can be constructed using a block cipher, where the final ciphertext block after processing acts as the MAC tag.

### Exercise: Deriving MACs from Hash Functions

Creating a MAC from a hash function and a key is not as straightforward as it may seem. The document highlights this through an exercise, questioning the security of three potential methods of combining a hash function `H` and symmetric keys `k1`, `k2` to create a MAC. The three methods are:
1. Secret Prefix: `H1 = H(k1||x)`
2. Secret Suffix: `H2 = H(x||k2)`
3. Envelope Method: `H3 = H(k1||x||k2)`

The document suggests that all three methods might not be as secure as expected and prompts for an explanation, hinting at specific references. Additionally, it asks for an explanation on how HMAC converts an unkeyed hash function into a MAC, providing a general construction for this process.

## Conclusion

In summary, message authentication and data origin authentication are critical services in ensuring the integrity and authenticity of digital communications. Through the use of MACs, parties can verify the integrity of the received message and authenticate the sender, although limitations such as the lack of non-repudiation need to be considered. The document provides a comprehensive understanding of how MACs work, their practical implementations, and the challenges associated with creating MACs from hash functions, ensuring a robust grasp of the topic.
