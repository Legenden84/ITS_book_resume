Chapter 2: Cryptographic Building Blocks

The chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental cryptographic mechanisms crucial for computer security, likening cryptography to the electrical wiring and power supply in house-building. The main focus is on symmetric-key and public-key encryption, public-key digital signatures, hash functions, and message authentication codes, setting the groundwork for computer security practices.

Comparatively, other professionals in construction (framers, roofers, plumbers, masons) must have basic knowledge of electricity to ensure safety, but they donâ€™t need to delve into the intricate details of electrical installations. Similarly, the chapter emphasizes that while a deep understanding of cryptography is not the central focus, knowing how to effectively use cryptographic tools is vital. The aim is to equip software developers with the knowledge to properly implement cryptographic toolkits rather than to create or design them from scratch.

The chapter discourages designing cryptographic protocols or algorithms independently, advocating for reliance on established and proven solutions. This is akin to handling basic electrical tasks oneself but leaving complex electrical work to a master electrician. Brief mention is made of digital certificates, with the promise of a more extensive discussion in Chapter 8. Chapters 3 and 4 are highlighted as resources for further background on Shannon entropy, one-time password hash chains, authentication protocols, and key establishment, including the Diffie-Hellman key agreement.
