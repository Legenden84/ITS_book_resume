# Chapter 2.1: Encryption and Decryption (Generic Concepts)

## Introduction
The section discusses the fundamental concepts of encryption and decryption algorithms, central to providing data confidentiality in distributed communication systems. Encryption algorithms are parameterized using cryptographic keys, viewed as large, secret numbers represented by binary strings.

## Plaintext and Ciphertext
- **Definition**: Encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext), which is a reversible process using a decryption key.
- **Security Aspect**: Only authorized parties should have access to the decryption key, ensuring data confidentiality during transmission and storage.

## Generic Encryption Notation
- **Representation**: Let $m$ be a plaintext message, $c$ the ciphertext, and $E_k, D_{k'}$ the encryption and decryption algorithms parameterized by symmetric keys $k$ and $k'$, respectively.
- **Mathematical Formulation**: 
  - Encryption: $c = E_k(m)$
  - Decryption: $m = D_{k'}(c)$

## Case Study: Caesar Cipher
- **Description**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
- **Task**: The reader is encouraged to mathematically describe the encryption ($E$) and decryption ($D$) algorithms of the Caesar cipher and discuss its cryptographic key.

## Cryptosystem: A Mathematical View
- **Components**: A cryptosystem consists of sets of possible plaintexts (P), ciphertexts (C), keys (K), an encryption mapping $E: (P \times K) \rightarrow C$, and a decryption mapping $D: (C \times K) \rightarrow P$.

## Exhaustive Key Search
- **Security Criterion**: A cryptosystem should be secure enough to make it infeasible for an attacker to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext without the decryption key.
- **Adversaryâ€™s Strategy**: In absence of algorithmic weaknesses, an adversary might attempt an exhaustive key search, trying all possible keys until finding the correct one.

## Example: DES Key Space
- **Historical Context**: DES, with its 56-bit key length, was the first widely-used cipher, standardized in 1977, but is now obsolete due to vulnerability to exhaustive key searches with modern processors.

## Cipher Attack Models
- **Types**: 
  - Ciphertext-only Attack: Adversary has access only to the ciphertext.
  - Known-plaintext Attack: Adversary has access to some plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext.
  - Chosen-plaintext Attack: Adversary can choose some plaintext and see the resulting ciphertext.
  - Chosen-ciphertext Attack: Adversary can provide ciphertext of their choosing and receive back the corresponding plaintext.
- **Ideal Encryption Algorithm**: Should resist all these attack models, leaving only exhaustive search as a viable attack strategy.

## Passive vs. Active Adversary
- **Passive Adversary**: Observes and records information without altering it.
- **Active Adversary**: Interacts with ongoing transmissions, injecting or altering data, or starts new interactions with legitimate parties.
