# 6.3 Stack-based Buffer Overflows

A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, similar to overfilling a glass with water. In languages such as C, there are no inherent safeguards against this, which leads to potential overwriting of adjacent memory areas. These overflows can happen naturally, with effects ranging from crashes and incorrect outputs to sometimes none at all. However, deliberate overflow attacks are a significant security concern.

## Memory Layout (Review)
Understanding how memory is structured is essential to grasp buffer overflow exploits. In typical Unix systems, the memory is laid out with environment variables and command-line arguments located just above the stack segment. Below the 'Text' segment, where the program code resides, you would find shared libraries. The 'BSS' (Block Started by Symbol), also known as the uninitialized data segment, holds statically allocated variables that do not have pre-set values. The data segment, comprising BSS and the 'Data' section, contains initialized static variables, including strings and arrays. When memory management functions rearrange memory, the data segment can grow, influencing how buffer overflows might be exploited.

## Stack Use on Function Calls
Buffer overflow attacks frequently target variables stored on the stack, which are a part of the stack frames used in function calls. A stack frame is a section of the stack that provides a function with its own isolated chunk of memory. This frame includes space for local variables and, in many architectures, it will also contain the return address for the function. The local variables are generally not placed in hardware registers but are allocated on the stack. To effectively execute an attack, an understanding of how the stack frames are laid out and how functions utilize the stack for storing variables is crucial. A buffer overflow in this context might overwrite the return address, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

## No-Op Sled
In constructing a buffer overflow exploit, one of the primary challenges is to precisely predict the stack's state at the time of the overflow to ensure that the injected malicious code is executed. To circumvent the need for such precision, attackers use a no-op sled, which is a sequence of NOP (no-operation) instructions. These NOPs act as a slide that leads into the actual malicious payload, increasing the chance that the control flow will hit the malicious code regardless of the exact address. Since a straight sequence of NOPs can be a clear indicator of an attack, sophisticated attackers may use sequences of instructions that effectively do nothing to disguise the sled. This method makes the no-op sled harder to detect and allows for a greater margin of error in the address that the exploit attempts to execute.

#### Example (Buffer Overflow)
Consider a function in C that creates a buffer overflow vulnerability:

```c
void myfunction(char *src) {
  int var1, var2;      // Allocates two words on the stack for integers.
  char var3[4];        // Allocates one word on the stack for a 4-byte buffer.
  strcpy(var3, src);   // Copies the contents of src into var3.
}
```
