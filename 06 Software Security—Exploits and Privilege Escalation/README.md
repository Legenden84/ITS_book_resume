# Chapter 6: Software Securityâ€”Exploits and Privilege Escalation

This chapter delves into the realm of software security, differentiating it from security software, and focusing on how attackers exploit vulnerabilities in common software programs. It emphasizes the significance of understanding these vulnerabilities that stem primarily from poor memory management and the misuse of programming language features, system architectures, and supporting functionalities.

The chapter underscores that once an attacker gains initial access to a system, they often attempt to escalate their privileges to a superuser or supervisor level. This allows them unparalleled access to user files, privileged software commands, and the ability to alter other users' permissions. Buffer overflows are highlighted as a prime example of how attackers exploit weak memory management controls to achieve this.

It is crucial to differentiate software security attacks from other types of security breaches, such as password theft, web-related injection attacks, and various malware strategies discussed in other chapters. The chapter particularly mentions rootkits, which may employ buffer overflow exploits and shellcode to infiltrate a system, and subsequently use other techniques to maintain a concealed presence.

The bulk of the chapter is dedicated to explicating how these attacks are executed, advocating that a comprehensive understanding of these attacks is imperative for developing effective defenses. Attackers often share their knowledge and tools on dubious platforms, necessitating that defenders are equally knowledgeable to counter these threats effectively. The text promotes the idea that concrete examples and live demonstrations, such as penetration testing, are invaluable for validating the feasibility of attacks and for educating defenders.

In conclusion, while traditional defensive tools like anti-virus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems play a crucial role, the chapter establishes software security as a vital subdiscipline in its own right. This emergence stems from the acknowledgment that the root of many security issues lies in the poor quality of ordinary software, necessitating a focus on improving software security independently of surrounding mechanisms or embedded security features.
