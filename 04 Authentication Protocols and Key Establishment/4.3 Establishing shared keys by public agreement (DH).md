# 4.3 Establishing Shared Keys by Public Agreement (DH)

### Diffie-Hellman key agreement
The Diffie-Hellman key agreement (DH) protocol, conceived in 1976, enables two parties to establish a shared secret over a public channel without prior contact or shared keys. The protocol's security relies on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. It operates as follows:

1. **Key Exchange Process:**
   - **Party A to Party B:** Sends `g^a mod p`, where `a` is A's private key.
   - **Party B to Party A:** Sends `g^b mod p`, where `b` is B's private key.
   - Both A and B compute the shared secret `K` using their respective private keys and the received values. The computed `K` is equal due to the properties of modular exponentiation.

2. **Security Foundation:**
   - The private keys `a` and `b` are large random numbers.
   - It is impractical for an eavesdropper to determine `a` or `b` from `g^a mod p` and `g^b mod p`.
   - The prime number `p` must be large, and `p-1` should have a large prime factor to ensure security.

### Postprocessing by KD
The shared secret `K` from DH is typically not used directly but fed into a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to produce the session key for encryption, enhancing security.

### Elgamal encryption
Elgamal encryption is a variation of DH for encrypting messages. It involves public and private keys where:

- **Key Generation:**
  - A recipient A uses `g` and `p` to compute `g^a mod p` and shares it as their public key.
- **Encryption:**
  - A sender B encrypts a message `m` using A's public key and a new random `k` each time to produce a ciphertext `(y, d)`.
- **Decryption:**
  - The recipient A uses their private key to compute `t` and then recovers `m` using `d` and `t`.

### Textbook DH meets small-subgroup attackes
Practical implementations of DH need to perform additional checks to defend against small-subgroup attacks where attackers may manipulate exchanged values to force the shared secret into a small, predictable set. These attacks and defenses are more thoroughly explored in Section 4.8 of the text.

### Basic Diffie-Hellman is unauthenticated
While secure against passive eavesdropping, DH does not inherently protect against active attackers who can modify the key exchange messages. This leads to vulnerabilities such as middle-person attacks.

### Man-In-The-Middle
The man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) involves an attacker intercepting and altering the key exchange in DH:

- The attacker establishes separate keys with both legitimate parties.
- The attacker can decrypt, modify, and inject messages, unbeknownst to the legitimate parties.
- A real-world analogy is given with the "Grandmaster postal chess" example, where an intermediary, Charlie, dishonestly improves his chess rating by playing intermediatory between two grandmasters, essentially having them play against each other while thinking they are playing against him.

### Proving knowledge of a secret does not rule out Man-In-The-Middle
Even knowing a shared secret or password cannot reveal a middle-person in the exchange, as the attacker can relay information, undetected, between the parties.

### STS protocol
The Station-to-Station (STS) protocol authenticates DH by incorporating digital signatures. It secures the key exchange by encrypting parts of the protocol with the shared secret and authenticating the messages with digital signatures. The process includes:

1. **Key Exchange with Signatures:**
   - A to B: `ga`
   - B to A: `gb` and B's signature on `gb` and `ga`, plus B's certificate, all encrypted with `K`.
   - A to B: A's signature on `ga` and `gb`, plus A's certificate, also encrypted with `K`.

2. **Certificate Usage:**
   - Public-key certificates validate the identities of the parties. They may be replaced by identifiers if the parties already possess authentic public keys of each other.
   - Certificates remain hidden from eavesdroppers when encrypted, preserving anonymity.

The STS protocol, along with detailed attack examples and protocol properties, are elaborated in subsequent sections, aiding in understanding the nuances of secure communication.
