# 1.1 Fundamental Goals of Computer Security

The section outlines computer security as a multidisciplinary practice aimed at protecting digital assets from unauthorized actions and mitigating their potential consequences. The focus is on safeguarding data, hardware, software, and related networks, ensuring only authorized entities have access or control. While unintentional damages are acknowledged, the main emphasis is on intentional misuse by unauthorized parties.

## Core Goals of Computer Security:
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that non-public information remains accessible only to authorized individuals, whether the data is stored or in transit. This is achieved through various means, including access control, encryption, and physical security measures.

2. **Integrity**: Maintaining the original state of data, software, or hardware, making alterations possible only by authorized entities. Techniques like error detection, access control, and cryptographic checksums are utilized to uphold integrity.

3. **Authorization**: Guaranteeing that computing resources are accessible exclusively by authorized entities, managed through access control mechanisms.

4. **Availability**: Keeping information, services, and resources readily accessible for authorized use, requiring protection against intentional disruptions and ensuring reliable hardware and software.

5. **Authentication**: Verifying the genuineness of principals, data, or software, supporting both authorization and integrity. This includes entity authentication and data origin authentication.

6. **Accountability**: Establishing the ability to trace back actions to responsible principals, crucial for maintaining a reliable electronic environment. This is achieved through comprehensive logging and transaction evidence.

## Important Distinctions:
- **Trusted vs. Trustworthy**: Trustworthy entities reliably meet expectations, whereas trusted entities are simply relied upon, regardless of their reliability.
- **Confidentiality vs. Privacy, and Anonymity**: Confidentiality pertains to protecting information from unauthorized disclosure. Privacy is a subset, focusing on personally sensitive information. Anonymity relates to keeping actions or involvement unlinked to a public identity.

While privacy and anonymity are not the main subjects of this book, the security mechanisms discussed are integral in supporting these concepts.
