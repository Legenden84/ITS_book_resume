# Chapter 1: Security Concepts and Principles

This chapter delves into the expansive realm of computer and Internet security, focusing on safeguarding software, computers, networks, transmitted information, and stored files. The term 'computer' herein encompasses a broad spectrum of programmable computing and communication devices, ranging from PCs and mobile devices to servers and network equipment. The discussion extends to the interaction between these devices, their potential misuse, and the essential software running on them.

## Key Focus Areas
- **Computers and Devices**: Including PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, servers, and network devices.
- **Servers**: Encompassing front-end servers for websites, back-end servers for databases, and intermediary nodes for information relay.
- **Network Devices**: Covering firewalls, routers, and switches.

## Core Objectives and Principles
- **Primary Objectives of Computer Security**: The chapter introduces the foundational goals of computer security, framing them as services provided to users and system components.
- **Security Design Principles**: A comprehensive set of guidelines will be explored later in the chapter to aid in developing robust security systems.

The chapter promises an in-depth exploration of how these elements interact, the potential risks, and the guiding principles for establishing a secure computing environment.
