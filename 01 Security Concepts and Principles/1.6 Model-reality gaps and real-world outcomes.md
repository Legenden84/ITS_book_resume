1.6 Model-reality gaps and real-world outcomes
This section delves into the complexities of threat modeling, emphasizing the challenges it presents and its crucial role in fulfilling security policy objectives.

### 1.6.1 Threat modeling and model-reality gaps
Threat modeling is a complex task, illustrated by a scenario involving a hotel safebox. The uncertainties around the hotel staff’s integrity and the security of the electronic safe highlight potential gaps between the threat model and reality. The quality of a threat model depends on its accurate reflection of the system and its environment, with major gaps often arising from invalid assumptions and focusing on the wrong threats. These gaps can be attributed to a lack of adaptation to technological and capability changes, incomplete or incorrect information, over-simplification, and abstraction. A robust threat model combines practical experience and analytical reasoning, continuously adapting to evolving threats and technologies.

### 1.6.2 Tying security policy back to real outcomes and security analysis
Connecting security to security policy involves understanding the role of defenses in supporting policy objectives and analyzing potential outcomes. These outcomes range from the failure of defenses in supporting the policy, successful prevention of policy violations with a comprehensive policy, to the formal policy not fully capturing the actual security requirements. The iterative process of security design and analysis includes identifying valuable assets, determining protection forms, refining security requirements, shaping security policy, and selecting suitable security mechanisms. Testing remains an incomplete measure of security due to its inability to account for unforeseen attacks and its limitation to certain attack classes. Security’s unobservability and the difficulty in assuring its presence due to the complex interaction of system elements add to the challenges in the field.

### Debriefing and Iterative Process
The real-world examples of online trading fraud, phishing of one-time passwords, and bypassing perimeter defenses underscore the repercussions of incorrect threat models and assumptions. The iterative nature of threat modeling necessitates continuous adaptation to new information, threats, and changing conditions, aiming to improve security policies and confidence in protective measures.

### Security Analysis and Assurance
The security analysis involves a series of key questions aimed at identifying valuable assets, potential threats, and mitigation strategies. Despite thorough testing and analysis, complete assurance is unattainable, emphasizing the importance of experience and learning from past attacks and mistakes.

### Testing and Security’s Unobservability
Security testing aims to validate the implementation of security measures, though it cannot confirm the absence of exploitable flaws, distinguishing it from regular software testing. The unobservability of security, its emergence from complex system interactions, and the partial and difficult nature of assurance further highlight the challenges in achieving and maintaining security.

By extensively discussing these aspects, the section reinforces the importance of a meticulous and adaptive approach to threat modeling and security analysis, underscoring the inherent challenges and the need for continuous improvement in security practices.
