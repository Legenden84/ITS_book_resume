# 1.2 Computer Security Policies and Attacks

This section delves into the necessity for precise definitions and a robust security-specific vocabulary to ensure clarity in computer security practices. Ambiguity is highlighted as a major enemy of security, necessitating clear and unambiguous communication.

## Computer Security Basics:
- **Assets and Policy**: Security is defined relative to protecting assets, encompassing information, software, hardware, and computing services. Security policies formally lay down the systemâ€™s rules, specifying what is allowed or forbidden, detailing asset protection, access permissions, and necessary system controls.

- **Theory vs. Practice**: Ideally, security policies should precisely categorize all system states as secure or non-secure, guiding the system to maintain a secure state and prevent unauthorized transitions. In reality, security policies might be informal, underlining guidelines and expectations, and their importance is often underestimated until a security breach occurs.

## Understanding Attacks and Threats:
- **Attacks and Agents**: An attack is a deliberate action aiming to violate security, often exploiting vulnerabilities like design flaws or configuration issues. The initiator of the potential attack is termed an adversary, and when the threat is activated, an attacker.

- **Threats**: A threat encompasses any situation or entity that might harm assets or breach security. A credible threat combines capability with malicious intent. Security practices aim to mitigate threats by identifying and removing vulnerabilities, thus nullifying potential attack vectors.

- **Controls**: While security policies identify when a violation occurs, controls and countermeasures are necessary to enforce these policies. These include operational processes, software monitors, and various technical security mechanisms.

## Illustrative Example:
- **House Security Policy**: Drawing a parallel with house security, a policy might state that only family members or escorted guests are allowed in, with violations clearly defined. An unlocked back door represents a vulnerability, and a stranger entering and stealing would be an attack, with the back door being the attack vector.

By defining computer security with precision and clarity, the section emphasizes the importance of unambiguous communication and robust policies to protect digital assets, mitigate threats, and ensure a secure environment.
