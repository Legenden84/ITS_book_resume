# 1.8 Why computer security is hard

Despite significant advancements in computing hardware, software, and environments, many of todayâ€™s central challenges in computer security remain consistent with those from decades past. This is exemplified by the comparison of the 1988 Internet worm with the Code Red worm and related incidents from 2001-2003. While the methods of attack were remarkably similar, the impacts were magnified due to the increased size of the Internet user base. This underscores the enduring relevance of foundational computer security principles, as well as the complexity of applying these principles in practice.

## Challenges in Computer Security:

1. **Intelligent Adversaries**: Attackers are adaptable, learning from past incidents, often with economic motivations.
2. **Lack of Rulebook for Attackers**: While defenders adhere to protocols and standards, attackers operate without such constraints.
3. **Defender-Attacker Asymmetry**: Attackers only need to find one vulnerability, whereas defenders must secure all potential points of attack.
4. **Scale of Attack**: The Internet facilitates large-scale attacks at low costs, with the ability to easily amplify malicious communications.
5. **Universal Connectivity**: The widespread connectivity of devices enables attackers to operate from afar, reducing their risk.
6. **Rapid Technology Evolution**: Constant updates in hardware and software necessitate continuous patches and upgrades.
7. **Software Complexity**: The increasing size and complexity of software can lead to a super-linear growth in vulnerabilities.
8. **Developer Training and Tools**: Many developers lack security training, and building effective security tools is challenging.
9. **Interoperability and Backwards Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility across diverse systems can delay security updates.
10. **Market Economics and Stakeholders**: Market forces and stakeholder dynamics can impede investments in security.
11. **Features Over Security**: The market tends to favor feature-rich products over simpler, potentially more secure options.
12. **Low Cost Over Quality**: Lower-cost, less secure options often prevail in the market, exacerbated by a lack of liability for software.
13. **Lack of Danger Signals**: The digital nature of cyberspace obscures the immediate consequences of security breaches.
14. **Managing Secrets**: The difficulty of managing cryptographic keys and passwords adds to the complexity of computer security.
15. **User Non-Compliance**: Users may circumvent security measures they find inconvenient.
16. **Error-Inducing Design**: Designing intuitive and secure user interfaces is a significant challenge.
17. **Non-Expert Users**: Many users today lack technical expertise, increasing the difficulty of maintaining security.
18. **Security Not Designed In**: The Internet and computers were not originally designed with security in mind, making retrofits challenging.
19. **New Exposures**: Introducing new security measures can inadvertently create new vulnerabilities.
20. **Government Obstacles**: Government interests in surveillance can conflict with the goal of enhancing security.

## Opportunities and Motivation:

Despite these challenges, there is optimism and opportunity in striving to overcome them, particularly as our dependence on the Internet and associated technologies grows. The ubiquity of computers and the Internet in daily life, from personal use to critical infrastructure, underscores the need for reliable security. Furthermore, the field of computer security presents robust career prospects, contributing not only to individual job security but also to the broader societal goal of a secure and dependable digital world.
