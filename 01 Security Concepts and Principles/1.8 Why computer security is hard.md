The text addresses the persistent and evolving challenges in computer security, reflecting on how many of today’s issues stem from decades-old problems, despite monumental shifts in computing technology. The 1988 Internet worm is cited as an early example of a large-scale security incident, with subsequent worms like Code Red in 2001-2003 following similar patterns but having more substantial impacts due to the increased Internet user base. This illustrates the enduring relevance of computer security principles and the difficulties in applying them practically. 

The text lists and explains 20 aspects that contribute to these difficulties, spanning from the intelligent nature of adversaries, asymmetry between attackers and defenders, rapid technological changes, software complexity, human factors, economic considerations, and governmental obstacles. The adversaries are highlighted as adaptive and economically motivated, with no rules to bind them, whereas defenders have to secure against all possible attack points, making the task inherently imbalanced. 

The Internet’s scale and universal connectivity enable attacks from a distance with little traceability, and the continuous churn in technology demands constant updates and patches, further complicating security. Software complexity and a lack of developer training in security are noted as significant issues, alongside challenges with interoperability, backward compatibility, and market forces that often prioritize features and low cost over security. 

Human factors like non-compliance, error-inducing design, and the influx of non-expert users add to the complexity, with the original design of computers and the Internet lacking security considerations. The deployment of security measures can introduce new vulnerabilities, and governmental policies may hinder robust protection practices.

In conclusion, despite the daunting list of challenges, the text adopts an optimistic view, seeing these issues as opportunities for improvement and emphasizing the critical need for understanding computer security. The ubiquity of software in our daily lives, from personal devices to critical infrastructure, underscores the necessity of security and dependability, positioning security expertise not just as a viable career choice but as a societal imperative to create a safer and more trustworthy digital world.
