## 1.7 â€¡Design principles for computer security

### Overview
Designing secure computer-based systems is a complex task, as there is no comprehensive checklist that guarantees security due to the wide variety of technologies, environments, applications, and requirements. Designers are encouraged to understand and adhere to key security design principles, which are detailed in this section and revisited throughout the book with practical examples.

### Principles

#### P1 SIMPLICITY-AND-NECESSITY
- Aim for simplicity in design, minimizing components and functionality.
- Disable unused functionality and prefer minimal installations.
- This principle supports minimizing the attack surface and ensures easier analysis, reducing errors.

#### P2 SAFE-DEFAULTS
- Use safe default settings, knowing that defaults often remain unchanged.
- For access control, employ a deny-by-default strategy.
- Encourage fail-safe designs, where systems fail in a secure state.
- For data transmission, use opportunistic encryption, but be cautious with stored data due to the complexities of key management.

#### P3 OPEN-DESIGN
- Avoid security through obscurity; encourage open review and analysis.
- Use unpredictability strategically, protecting tactical defense details.
- Be careful with exposing error messages or timing data that could leak secrets.

#### P4 COMPLETE-MEDIATION
- Verify proper authority for every access to every object, ideally just before access is granted.
- This involves authentication, authorization, and integrity checks.

#### P5 ISOLATED-COMPARTMENTS
- Use strong isolation structures to compartmentalize system components, limiting damage in case of failures and preventing privilege escalation.
- Define observable paths for authorized cross-component communication.

#### P6 LEAST-PRIVILEGE
- Allocate the minimum necessary privileges for a task and for the shortest duration necessary.
- Drop and reacquire privileges as needed.

#### P7 MODULAR-DESIGN
- Avoid monolithic designs; prefer object-oriented and finer-grained designs for privilege segregation.
- Related to separation of duties in financial accounting.

#### P8 SMALL-TRUSTED-BASES
- Strive for small code size in trusted components, focusing security analysis on these critical parts.
- Keep secrets to a minimum and differentiate mechanism from secret.

#### P9 TIME-TESTED-TOOLS
- Prefer using well-established security tools and protocols over designing your own.
- Confidence in a tool increases with its time under scrutiny and use.

#### P10 LEAST-SURPRISE
- Design mechanisms to align with users' expectations and mental models, reducing user errors.
- Tailor designs to the experience level of the target user.

#### P11 USER-BUY-IN
- Make security mechanisms user-friendly and clearly beneficial to encourage use and compliance.

#### P12 SUFFICIENT-WORK-FACTOR
- Ensure security mechanisms are configured to make attacks prohibitively expensive for anticipated adversaries.

#### P13 DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH
- Implement multiple layers of defense, forcing attackers to overcome multiple hurdles.
- Strengthen the weakest link in the defense chain.

#### P14 EVIDENCE-PRODUCTION
- Record system activities to facilitate accountability, intrusion detection, and recovery from failures.

#### P15 DATATYPE-VALIDATION
- Ensure all received data meets expected properties or data types, preventing data from being processed as code.

#### P16 REMNANT-REMOVAL
- Upon session or program termination, remove all traces of sensitive data.

#### P17 TRUST-ANCHOR-JUSTIFICATION
- Justify confidence in any base point of assumed trust, and verify trust assumptions wherever possible.

#### P18 INDEPENDENT-CONFIRMATION
- Use simple, independent checks to increase confidence in code or data integrity, especially when received from external sources.

#### P19 REQUEST-RESPONSE-INTEGRITY
- Ensure responses in distributed protocols match their corresponding requests, including cryptographic integrity checks.

#### P20 RELUCTANT-ALLOCATION
- Be cautious in interactions with unauthenticated external agents to mitigate denial of service attacks.

### Higher-Level Principles and Maxim

#### HP1 SECURITY-BY-DESIGN
- Integrate security from the initial design stage, clearly stating design goals and security-related assumptions.

This section underscores the importance of a holistic and meticulous approach to security design, emphasizing simplicity, caution with defaults, open design for scrutiny, comprehensive authorization checks, compartmentalization, minimal privilege allocation, modular design, reliance on tested tools, user-friendly designs, sufficient work factors for defense, layered defenses, evidence production for accountability, strict data type validation, remnant data removal, justified trust, independent confirmation of integrity, integrity in request-response protocols, and cautious resource allocation to prevent denial of service attacks. The higher-level principle of security-by-design is highlighted, emphasizing the integration of security from the onset of system development.
