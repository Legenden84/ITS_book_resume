## 11.5 Address Resolution Attacks (DNS, ARP)
In this section, the discussion revolves around two types of traffic-hijacking attacks: DNS (Domain Name System) Pharming and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Spoofing. Both types exploit vulnerabilities in providing REQUEST-RESPONSE-INTEGRITY (principle P19).

### DNS: Domain Name System
DNS is responsible for converting human-readable domain names to IP addresses. The DNS mapping process is distributed across various authoritative hosts of different organizations, with responses provided through server programs on UDP port 53. The local DNS resolver, provided by the operating system, assists client applications in this resolution process, contacting numerous DNS servers in a hierarchical manner until reaching the authoritative source.

#### Example: DNS Resolution
Consider resolving "www.tgtserver.com". The process starts with the local DNS resolver, moving up to the ISPâ€™s local and regional DNS servers through recursive queries. Following this, a series of interactive queries traverse the global DNS hierarchy, eventually reaching the authoritative server for "tgtserver.com" and retrieving the corresponding IP address. This information is then cached at various points for faster future access.

### Pharming and DNS Resolution Attacks
Pharming is an attack that falsifies the DNS mapping between a domain name and an IP address, leading users to incorrect websites even if they manually type the correct domain. This is possible due to the lack of cryptographic protection in basic DNS queries and responses.

#### Examples: DNS Resolution Attacks
1. **Local Files**: Malware can tamper with the local "hosts" file or the DNS client cache.
2. **Intermediate DNS Servers**: Both DNS caches and authoritative name servers are susceptible to tampering by malware or malicious insiders.
3. **Network-based Response Alteration**: Attackers can alter DNS responses in transit.
4. **Malicious DNS Server Settings**: Clients can be configured to use malicious external DNS servers, especially when connected to untrusted networks.

### Pharming Defenses
Despite DNS being a critical infrastructure, many of its security aspects are beyond the control of end-users. Avoiding untrusted networks is a common advice, but not always practical. A more reliable long-term solution is DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions), which provides digitally signed DNS responses. However, its deployment has been slow due to the complexity involved in establishing a universal supporting public-key infrastructure.

### ARP: Address Resolution Protocol
ARP operates within a LAN, mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses. When a host needs to find the MAC address corresponding to an IP address, it sends out a LAN broadcast message. The target device responds with its IP and MAC address pair, which is then cached locally to reduce future ARP requests.

#### ARP Spoofing
Attackers can exploit ARP by sending false ARP replies, associating their MAC address with the IP address of another device on the same LAN. This results in poisoned ARP caches, allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially alter traffic meant for other devices.

### ARP Spoofing Defenses
Static, read-only ARP tables can prevent ARP spoofing, but require manual setup and maintenance. Tools exist to detect and prevent ARP spoofing, and a long-term solution would involve an upgraded ARP with reliable authentication mechanisms.
