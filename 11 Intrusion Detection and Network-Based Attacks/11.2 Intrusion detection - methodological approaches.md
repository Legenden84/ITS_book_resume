# 11.2 Intrusion Detection: Methodological Approaches

## Introduction
This section provides a comprehensive analysis of intrusion detection system (IDS) methodologies, outlining the three major philosophical approaches: signature-based, specification-based, and anomaly-based. These approaches encompass various methods and sometimes overlap in categories, creating a nuanced landscape for intrusion detection.

## Signature-Based Approach

### Overview
- **Definition**: Signature-based IDS look for specific patterns or sequences that indicate known malicious activities.
- **Mechanics**: These patterns, known as signatures, can range from raw byte sequences to more complex condition lists. The system triggers an alarm when a match is found.
  
### Advantages and Challenges
- **Speed and Accuracy**: Signature-based IDS are fast and accurate for known threats.
- **Continuous Update Requirement**: The signature database needs constant updates as it only recognizes known threats. Many intrusion prevention systems (IPS) automate this process through vendor signature updates.
- **Behavior-Based Variants**: Some variants generalize patterns to detect attack side effects or outcomes, providing indirect evidence of attacks.

## Specification-Based Approach

### Overview
- **Definition**: This approach involves creating a detailed specification of allowed behaviors for each protocol or application, with tools to verify conformance.
  
### Advantages and Challenges
- **Detection of Unseen Attacks**: Unlike signature-based IDS, specification-based approaches can detect new attacks.
- **Low False Alarms on Legitimate Behavior**: It does not raise false alarms for unusual but legitimate behaviors, a significant advantage over anomaly-based approaches.
- **Resource Intensive**: Developing specifications and tools is time-consuming and protocol-specific.
- **Risk of False Negatives**: If the behavior characterization is too lenient, attacks might be missed.

## Anomaly-Based Approach

### Overview
- **Definition**: This approach involves creating profiles of normal activity and identifying deviations during operation.

### Advantages and Challenges
- **Detection of Unseen Attacks**: Like specification-based approaches, anomaly-based IDS can detect new attacks.
- **High False Positive Rates**: Legitimate but unusual user behavior can trigger false alarms.
- **Feature Selection Challenge**: Choosing the right system behavior features for profiles is crucial and challenging.
- **Intruder-Free Training**: Ensuring no malicious activity is present during the profile training phase is vital.
- **Session Creep**: Self-adjusting profiles can be exploited by attackers, embedding malicious behavior into the baseline over time.
