# 11.4 Denial of Service Attacks

## Introduction
The sections from 11.4 to 11.6 provide an overview of network-based attacks, highlighting their influence on security designs and defense strategies. This is crucial for understanding potential threats and preparing robust security mechanisms.

## Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
DoS attacks aim to make resources and services unavailable for legitimate users, severely degrading performance or causing complete failure. There are two primary classes of DoS attacks:

### 1. Exploitation of Implementation Flaws
This involves exploiting software vulnerabilities to degrade performance or cause system failure.

### 2. Resource Exhaustion
This involves overwhelming the target's resources (bandwidth, CPU, memory, disk) by flooding it with traffic or consuming its fixed resources. Flooding attacks can be initiated even by a single machine, limited by its CPU speed and link capacity.

## Motives Behind DoS Attacks
DoS attacks can be motivated by various factors, including:

1. Financial gain via extortion.
2. Commercial competitive advantage.
3. Ideological or social activism.
4. Information warfare by nation-states.
5. Hacker experimentation for recognition or ego-boosting.
6. Vengeance against targeted resources.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
DDoS attacks utilize a multitude of devices spread across different addresses (e.g., botnets) to flood the target.

## Local vs Remote DoS
Local DoS attacks can involve buffer overflows or malware replication on a local host. However, this section focuses more on remote network-related DoS attacks, which do not require prior access to the target host.

## Examples of DoS Attacks

### DoS by Poison Packets
These attacks use malformed packets to exploit implementation errors and crash the system. Examples include Ping of Death, Teardrop, and LAND.

### SYN Flooding
This resource exhaustion attack targets the TCP/IP connection setup process, flooding the target with SYN packets and depleting its resources for half-open connections.

## UDP and ICMP Floods
These brute-force attacks overwhelm the target's bandwidth and CPU by sending a large number of ICMP or UDP packets.

## Smurf Flood
This ICMP flood attack uses broadcast addresses for amplification, overwhelming both the target network's bandwidth and the path back to the spoofed source address.

## Mitigations and Defenses

### Smurf Mitigation
This involves configuring routers to drop packets with broadcast address destinations and host OSs to ignore ICMP packets for IP broadcast addresses.

### Ingress Filtering
This technique filters incoming packets based on source addresses, helping to mitigate DoS attacks that employ IP spoofing.

### Amplification
Many DoS attacks benefit from amplification, where a single message results in multiple responses or a larger response. Effective communications protocol design is crucial for preventing such attacks.

## Summary Comments on Attacks
While DoS attacks are noticeable, they are challenging to fully resolve due to their social and technical aspects. Flooding attacks are particularly difficult to prevent, and the availability of botnets for DDoS attacks complicates the issue.

## Summary Comments on Defenses
Effective on-host defenses include disabling unused services, OS rate-limiting of ICMP responses, and updating software. Network operators play a crucial role in flooding defenses, employing strategies like ingress/egress filtering and packet dropping. Investing in hardware redundancy and infrastructure, such as CDNs and server farms, also contributes to robust defenses against DoS attacks. Future networks require the design of protocols and services that are immune to amplification attacks to ensure long-term security and stability.
