# 11.1 Intrusion Detection: Introduction

## Comprehensive Overview
In this section, the intricacies of intrusion detection systems (IDS) are unpacked, offering a rich understanding of their significance in the broader context of network security. Firewalls are acknowledged for their ability to serve as preliminary barriers, blocking a majority of malicious activities at the network’s periphery. However, IDS are positioned as the sophisticated surveillance mechanisms that scrutinize what slips through these barriers, playing a crucial role in identifying potential security breaches.

## Intrusion Detection: Deeper Insights
- **Defining Intrusions**: Intrusions are classified as any events on a network or host that either breach the established security policies or are on the verge of putting the system in a compromised state. 
- **Intrusion Detection Mechanism**: The chapter emphasizes the proactive nature of intrusion detection, where system events are constantly monitored and analyzed to pinpoint potential security violations. 
- **IDS Functionality**: An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is portrayed as a comprehensive tool that automates the entire process of intrusion detection. It is not just about monitoring; it extends to logging pertinent data, analyzing it, and then providing mechanisms to report events that need human intervention.
- **Sources of Intrusion**: The chapter does not limit intrusions to external attacks. Instead, it broadens the scope to include unauthorized or rogue users, processes, programs, commands, and even questionable data states, whether at rest or in transit.

## Differentiating Detection and Prevention
- **IDS – A Passive Watchdog**: The IDS is characterized as a passive entity, detecting intrusions and adverse events, providing valuable data for after-the-fact analysis and ongoing attacks.
- **IPS – The Proactive Guardian**: On the other hand, an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is presented as the more proactive counterpart of IDS. It doesn’t just stop at detection; it takes active measures to prevent ongoing attacks, which could range from altering network configurations, stripping malware, or even terminating malicious processes.
- **Operational Modes and Differences**: The IPS can be configured to operate passively, essentially acting like an IDS. However, the chapter underscores that a true IPS is defined by its ability to respond in real-time, actively mitigating a subset of known attacks.

## Architectural Types and Their Significance
- **Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**: The chapter provides a clear demarcation between NIDS and HIDS. NIDS is depicted as the eagle eye, positioned at strategic network points to capture and analyze packet data, offering a network-wide perspective.
- **Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**: In contrast, HIDS is portrayed as the meticulous inspector of specific hosts. It dives deep into kernel-generated operations, application logs, file system changes, and a plethora of other host-specific activities.

## Event Outcomes and Error Rates: A Comprehensive Analysis
- **Understanding Event Outcomes**: The chapter breaks down the potential outcomes of event analysis in IDS, highlighting the desirable low error rates, and the challenges posed by false positives and negatives.
- **Error Rates and Their Impact**: High false positive rates can significantly impair the usability of an IDS, as analysts find themselves chasing after non-issues. Conversely, high false negative rates pose severe security risks, as actual intrusions go unnoticed.
- **Balancing Act and Trade-offs**: The chapter introduces the notion of trade-offs in IDS operations, drawing parallels with biometric authentication systems and highlighting the delicate balance that needs to be maintained between false positives and negatives.

## Real-World Example: Error Rates and Base Rates
- **Error Rates in Action**: The section provides a tangible example, using a disease screening scenario to illustrate how error rates and base rates play out in real-world settings.
- **Base Rates and Their Deception**: The example serves as a stark reminder of how base rates can deceive and distort our perception of accuracy, underscoring the need for precision and clarity in reporting and interpreting IDS metrics.
- **Implications for IDS**: Translating the example back to the realm of intrusion detection, the chapter paints a vivid picture of how similar challenges and misconceptions can arise, driving home the point that IDS operations are nuanced and require careful consideration of various factors.

## Intrusion Detection: Challenges and the Road Ahead
- **Base Rate Fallacy in IDS**: The chapter sheds light on the psychological trap of the base rate fallacy, illustrating how even seasoned professionals can overlook the significance of base rates in intrusion detection.
- **Managing False Positives**: The management of false positives is highlighted as a critical aspect of IDS operations, with the text emphasizing the operational and psychological challenges that arise when analysts are inundated with false alarms.
- **Resource Constraints and Tolerance Levels**: The chapter concludes by addressing the practical constraints of investigative resources, and the extremely low tolerance for false positives in end-user systems, using anti-virus software as a pertinent example.
