# 11.6 TCP Session Hijacking

## TCP Session Hijacking: Introduction and Its Serious Implications
TCP session hijacking is a critical security vulnerability that allows an on-path attacker to manipulate unencrypted TCP sessions with relative ease. The process, while conceptually straightforward, hinges on the attacker’s ability to overcome the sequence number mechanism that TCP/IP protocols use to synchronize packets during a session. This mechanism is meant to ensure that data is received and assembled in the correct order, but it can be manipulated if not adequately protected.

The attacker's job has been made easier by the wide availability of point-and-click toolkits, which handle the more complex aspects of this type of attack. The severity of TCP session hijacking cannot be overstated; it does not require the attacker to have any access to the host or any privileges therein. For example, in the context of a plaintext telnet session, an attacker could inject commands that will be executed with the permissions of the user running the victim session.

There are two primary variations of this attack. In the first, the attacker causes one of the legitimate end-hosts to lose its ability to participate in the session, effectively knocking it out of sync with the other end. In the second variation, the attacker positions themselves as a middle-person, relaying and potentially altering packets between the two legitimate hosts while maintaining correct header sequence numbers on the fly. These attacks are feasible when packets are sent in plaintext, and cryptographic authentication at the start of a session does not thwart them. This underscores the vital importance of using session encryption tools such as SSH, TLS, or IPsec, as they render sniffed packets unintelligible and cause injected packets to appear as meaningless bytes at the legitimate end-hosts.

## Distinguishing TCP Session Hijacking from Other Attacks
TCP session hijacking needs to be clearly distinguished from several other types of attacks:
1. HTTP session hijacking via cookie theft, which is covered in Chapter 9.
2. Middle-person attacks on Diffie-Hellman key agreement discussed in Chapter 4. These may employ DNS-based redirection to funnel packets to an attacker-controlled host.
3. ARP spoofing, which can be a component of a TCP session hijacking attack but is a distinct threat.

In the context of TLS, middle-person attacks might also exploit DNS-based redirection combined with fraudulent or misleading web site certificates to intercept and manipulate secure communications.

## TCP Sequence Numbers: Ensuring Order and Integrity
TCP relies heavily on sequence and acknowledgement numbers to manage the flow of data between hosts. Every byte of data transferred is numbered in separate sequences for each direction of communication. During the initial three-way handshake that establishes a TCP connection, each end chooses a new initial sequence number (ISN), and associates ISN + 1 with the first byte of data it will send.

The synchronization of sequence numbers is critical to ensuring that data can be correctly ordered and assembled at the receiving end, and that lost or out-of-order packets can be detected and handled appropriately. If sequence numbers fall outside of a valid range, TCP segments may be dropped, with the precise conditions depending on the TCP specification and details such as the size of the receive window.

The attacker’s goal in a TCP session hijacking scenario is to craft a packet with sequencing numbers that appear valid to the receiver’s TCP state machine, allowing them to insert malicious data into the ongoing session.

## TCP Session Hijacking: Manipulating the Communication Path
Imagine a TCP connection between two hosts, A and B, with an attacker, T, situated somewhere on the path that packets travel between them. T is in a position to read the contents of packets, including A’s IP address, and can use packet creation tools to send packets to B, impersonating A. While responses from B will not be addressed to T, T can still observe them by sniffing the network traffic.

For the session between A and B, T can gather details about the socket and the current sequence numbers in use, and use this information to craft and inject malicious packets into the session. However, this is not without its challenges and potential side effects.

## Hijacking Side Effects: Desynchronization and ACK Storms
One of the side effects of TCP session hijacking is the potential for desynchronization. If T is sending packets to B at the same time as A is sending packets to B, the sequence numbers T is using may become invalid, as they will be out of sync with A’s. To improve the odds of success, T might flood A with packets to slow down A’s ability to send packets to B, or send poison packets to disrupt A’s communication.

T might also actively attempt to desynchronize the byte numbering between A and B by tampering with the connection setup process. By intercepting and responding to the SYN–ACK packet from B to A with a RST segment and a new SYN with different sequence numbers, T can cause B to close the initial connection and open a new one, while A believes it has an established connection using different sequence numbers. This state of desynchronization prevents A and B from effectively communicating, but allows T to act as a middle-person, sniffing, modifying, and relaying packets between A and B with adjusted byte-number fields.

Another side effect is the potential for ACK storms. As T injects packets into the session that are acceptable to B, the sequence numbers and receive windows between T (impersonating A) and B advance. However, since A is out of sync, any packets it exchanges with B are likely to be dropped. In this situation, TCP mandates the sending of ACK segments (without data), leading to an endless loop of ACK segments being exchanged between A and B, further stressing the network and creating what is
