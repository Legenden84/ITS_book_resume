# 8.3 ‡Certificate Revocation

### Introduction
Certificates, similar to credit cards, have a set expiration date usually ranging from 1-2 years. However, their validity can be terminated prematurely, resulting in revocation. The responsibility of managing and disseminating information about revoked certificates falls on the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate, making them the designated revocation authority.

### Revocation Reasons
The primary reason for revoking public-key certificates is the compromise or suspected compromise of the Subject’s private key. Other reasons can include supersession by another key, discontinuation of the key’s use, or changes in the Subject’s job title or affiliation necessitating a new key.

### Methods of Revocation

#### Method I: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
CAs issue a signed, dated list of all revoked certificates which is then made available to the relevant community. This list can be distributed directly (push model) or made accessible at a specific location (pull model). The challenge with CRLs is their potential length, which can be mitigated by shortening the validity periods of certificates.

#### Method II: CRL Fragments—Partitions and Deltas
This method enhances efficiency by breaking the full CRL into smaller, signed, and dated sublists. Partitions divide the CRL based on serial number ranges, while delta CRLs provide updates to previous lists, allowing parties to build a complete CRL over time. CRL aggregator services may be used to manage delta CRLs.

#### Method III: Online Status Checking
Using protocols like OCSP, relying parties can verify a certificate’s status in real-time through a trusted online server. OCSP-stapling is a variation where certificate holders frequently obtain signed, timestamped validity assertions to present to relying parties.

#### Method IV: Short-Lived Certificates
Certificates are issued with very short validity periods, reducing the need for revocation. The downside is the overhead of frequent re-issuance.

#### Method V: Serving Trusted Public Keys Directly
This approach eliminates the need for revocation and potentially signed certificates altogether, relying instead on a trusted server to distribute valid keys. This method is more suited for closed systems but comes with significant trade-offs in server load and key management complexity.

### Special Considerations

#### Revoked Certificates: CA vs. End-Entity
Both CA and end-entity (leaf) certificates can be revoked. Special consideration is given to the revocation of CA certificates, with the X.509v3 standards including Certification Authority Revocation Lists (CARLs).

#### Denial of Service on Revocation
Certificate revocation is susceptible to denial of service attacks, which can force a system to fail closed (treating the certificate as revoked) or fail open (assuming the certificate is valid). The latter violates the principle of safe-defaults, potentially leading to reliance on a revoked certificate.

### Conclusion
Effective certificate revocation is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of digital communications. Various methods exist to manage this, each with its own set of trade-offs and considerations, underlining the complexity and importance of this aspect of digital security.
