# 8.6 Secure Email Overview and Public-Key Distribution

## Introduction to Secure Email
End-to-end secure email systems ensure the confidentiality and integrity of messages from the sender to the recipient. The sender's device is responsible for encrypting and signing the messages, while the recipient’s device handles decryption and verification. This secure method of communication has faced challenges, particularly in key management and the reliable acquisition of public keys from other users. Secure email has been instrumental in the development of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and certificate management standards, predating even the existence of TLS (Transport Layer Security).

## Major Technologies in Secure Email
Three significant technologies have emerged in the field of secure email:
1. **PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail):** This was the first comprehensive effort to provide secure email, operational from 1990 to 1995, and utilized a single-root PKI hierarchy. It is of historical and technical interest.
2. **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy):** Introduced in 1991, PGP is designed for private individuals and small, static groups. It employs an ad hoc approach to trust management, making it more suitable for technically adept users.
3. **S/MIME (Secure MIME):** This technology is best suited for enterprise users, including government departments and corporations, and utilizes centralized certificate management.

Further details on these technologies are provided in Section 8.7.

## Email Transport and Message Structure

### Email Transport
The process of sending an email involves several key components:
- **Mail User Agent (MUA):** This is the client-side application that sends emails to the originating user’s mail server or Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
- **Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs):** These servers handle the transfer of emails using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
- **Mail Delivery Agent (MDA):** This is the recipient’s mail server where emails are stored until retrieved by the recipient’s MUA.

Emails can be retrieved using various protocols, such as IMAP or POP3. The choice of protocol and the configuration of email storage (server-side, client-side, or both) are crucial considerations in end-to-end secure email systems.

### Regular Email Message Structure
Regular email messages have a specific structure, defined by mail transport standards. This includes the envelope, used for transport-related information, and the content section, which is what the user actually sees and interacts with. The content section itself is divided into the header (with fields like From, To/CC, Date, and Subject) and the message body.

### Secure Email Message Structure
When it comes to secure email, the goal is to maintain compatibility with existing systems while adding security features. This is typically achieved by adding security-specific elements to the content section of the email. These additions include a security header for managing encryption and digital signatures, and potentially an encrypted message body. For recipients using legacy systems, these additions appear as labeled fields followed by ASCII characters.

## Public-Key Distribution in Secure Email
Public-key distribution is a critical component of secure email systems, ensuring that users have access to the public keys necessary for encryption and digital signature verification. Two centralized methods are prevalent:
1. **Online Trusted Public-Key Server:** This method involves real-time retrieval of public keys from a trusted server.
2. **Certificate Directory:** This approach utilizes a repository of certificates signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), allowing users to retrieve public keys at any time.

These methods address the issue of scaling public-key distribution, avoiding the “n^2 key distribution” problem and providing a centralized approach to authenticate and distribute public keys.

## Pros and Cons of Using Certificates
Certificates play a crucial role in public-key distribution, but their use is not without challenges. On the one hand, certificates allow for the auditing of all public keys ever associated with a user, providing a level of accountability. On the other hand, the validity of a public key when using a certificate can become an issue over time, necessitating a robust certificate revocation infrastructure. Additionally, certificate validation requires careful attention to ensure that the certificate’s Subject field accurately represents the intended entity.

## Context and Challenges Beyond Secure Email
While end-to-end secure email provides a high level of security for message content, it is not without its challenges. Common webmail interfaces, for example, use TLS for encryption but leave the message body in cleartext on the server. Additionally, features like mailing lists and mail forwarding introduce complexity beyond the scope of this discussion. Another significant challenge arises in the form of content-based security measures employed by mail service providers to combat spam and malware. End-to-end encryption inherently prevents these measures from inspecting the content of messages, potentially allowing malicious content to pass through unchecked. While solutions like key escrow can provide a workaround, they come with their own set of trade-offs in terms of performance, security, and complexity.
