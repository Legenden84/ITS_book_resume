# 8.5 TLS Web Site Certificates and CA/Browser Trust Model

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)
TLS is the most widely used protocol for securing web browser-server traffic, evolving from SSL in 1994. Originally designed for HTTP to facilitate HTTPS, it has since been applied to numerous other protocols like FTP, SMTP, telnet, and LDAP. Its main security goals are to encrypt traffic for confidentiality and provide server authentication through public-key certificates. It also supports client authentication via certificates, although this is less commonly used.

## Trusted Certificate
A certificate is considered "trusted" when a browser or client, after performing certificate validation checks, deems it valid. However, trust can vary between different relying parties.

## Grades of TLS Certificates
Certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) for TLS come in different grades, depending on the level of validation:

### Domain Validated (DV) Certificates
- **Validation**: Minimal; requires demonstration of administrative control over the domain.
- **Cost**: Inexpensive, ranging from $10–$50, sometimes free.
- **Issuance**: Often fully automated.

### Organization Validated (OV) Certificates
- **Validation**: Requires domain control plus additional manual checks such as business name and address verification.
- **Display**: Browsers may show organization-related information, but differences from DV are often not noticed by end-users.

### Extended Validation (EV) Certificates
- **Motivation**: Addressing loss of confidence due to low-assurance DV certificates.
- **Validation**: Comprehensive checks on the legal entity, including real-world existence, government registration, physical location, and domain name control.
- **Display**: Browsers may display the Subject’s name and country in the URL bar.

### Individual Validated (IV) Certificates
These are certificates that users choose to accept despite them not being recognized by the client software’s trust anchors, such as self-signed certificates.

## CA/Browser Forum and EV Certificates
This industry association governs operational practices for issuing EV certificates and provides guidance for non-EV certificates. However, it acknowledges challenges in effectively communicating the added value of EV certificates to users.

## Self-Signed TLS Server Certificates
Previously common, these certificates have declined in popularity with the advent of free DV certificates. Browsers have adapted to discourage or disallow their use, particularly for non-leaf certificates, due to trust implications.

## Browser Trust Model Issues
The traditional browser trust model has several vulnerabilities and limitations, largely stemming from the fact that any CA can issue a certificate for any domain. This section highlights issues such as the acceptance of rogue certificates, the ease of mounting TLS-stripping attacks, poor support for revocation, lack of trust agility, and the unaccountability of intermediate CAs. These issues underscore the fragility of the current system and highlight areas where principles of secure design are violated.
