# 8.1 Certificates, Certification Authorities, and PKI

## Introduction
This section provides a foundational understanding of certificates, certification authorities (CAs), and the public-key infrastructure (PKI), delving into the integrity of public keys, the structure of public-key certificates, and the checks performed by CAs before issuing certificates.

## Integrity of Public Keys
Public keys, integral to cryptographic algorithms and protocols, must be authentic and integral, ensuring the associated private key is protected and belongs to the rightful owner. The risk lies in potential substitution of an intended recipient's public key with an opponent's, risking exposure of confidential messages.

## Public-Key Certificates
Public-key certificates bind a public key to its owner, facilitated through a digital signature by a trusted CA. Trust in the certificate relies on trust in the CA's competence and reliability. Relying parties must verify the CA's signature as part of validating the certificate's overall authenticity.

## Names in Certificates and Certificate Fields
Certificates include 'Subject' (owner) and 'Issuer' (signing CA) fields, consisting of unique identifiers or distinguished names (DNs), with common attributes like Country (C), Organization (O), and Common-Name (CN). Other certificate fields encompass the public key, validity period, and signature algorithm details, ensuring proper identification and safe use of the public key.

## CA Checks Before Issuing Certificates
CAs must perform due diligence before issuing a certificate, validating the association between an entity name and a public key, ensuring evidence of knowledge of the corresponding private key, ownership or control of related computer-addressable identities, and confirmation of natural-world names for high-quality certificates.

## Acquiring a Certificate
End-entities request certificates from CAs through standardized protocols, submitting a certification request including a DN, public key, and optional attributes. It's generally preferred for end-entities to generate their own key pairs to avoid trust issues with CAs.

## Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)
PKI encompasses technologies and processes for managing public and private keys, supporting authentication, encryption, data integrity, and digital signatures. It involves data structures, cryptographic toolkits, architectural components like CAs, and protocols for key and certificate management, enhancing automation, scalability, security, and convenience.

## Additional PKI Aspects
Managing long-term private keys presents challenges, particularly when stored encrypted under user-chosen passwords, risking offline password-guessing attacks. Lifecycle support for non-repudiable signatures adds complexity, requiring additional services like notaries, and sometimes involving Registration Authorities (RAs) to facilitate certificate requests.
