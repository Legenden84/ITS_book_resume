# 8.4 CA/PKI Architectures and Certificate Trust Models

## Overview
This section delves into the trust relationships between Certificate Authorities (CAs) and the utilization of trust anchor lists to outline PKI models applicable for TLS, secure email, and various applications.

## Trust Model Definition
A certificate trust model encompasses design, procedures, rules, software, and processes to help applications validate public-key certificates and dictate the permissible uses of their public keys. It's crucial to understand that trust models, being technical mechanisms, do not equate to determining the trustworthiness of entities.

## Model Philosophy vs. Technical Ability
Trust models guide technology to embody specific philosophies or achieve certain goals. However, providing a set of configurable software components doesn't define a trust model. The emphasis should be on facilitating specific purposes or applications, and the suitability of a trust model varies based on application, objectives, and control distribution.

## Toolbox Shaped to Meet Goals
The section outlines how data structures from ITU-T:X.500, X.509 certificates, and IETF RFCs create a toolbox for building customized trust models to cater to different communities or applications, each with their unique requirements. The narrative provides examples, discussing single-CA communities, CA hierarchies, and hybrid models.

## Model I: Single-CA Domains and Linking Them
This model involves single-CA domains without trust connections between different communities. Each operates as a closed trust system, though it can be extensive. An example with enterprise companies in different countries is provided, highlighting how trust can be established between different divisions using cross-certifications. However, this approach grows complex with the increase of CA pairs.

## Bridge CA
Introduced as an alternative for large peer networks, the Bridge CA model simplifies trust relationships by introducing a hub node, reducing cross-connect complexity. This model is especially relevant for extensive networks with numerous equal peers or trading partners.

## Model II: Strict Hierarchy
Described is a hierarchical trust system with multiple CAs arranged in a tree structure, typically enclosed within a single community. Advantages include clearly defined trust chains and straightforward trust relationships, with examples and illustrations provided for clarification.

## Hierarchy with Reverse Certificates
This section explores a variant of the strict hierarchy, introducing reverse certificates and local trust anchors for leaf nodes. This adjustment maintains the hierarchical structure while altering the trust chain dynamics and trust anchor assignments.

## Model III: Ring-Mesh of Tree Roots
Extending the idea to multi-CA domains arranged as hierarchical trees, the section discusses connecting these distinct trees at the root level, introducing various topologies including complete pairwise cross-connects, rings, and a Bridge CA model.

## Model IV: Forest of Hierarchical Trees (Browser Model)
This model presents an alternative to cross-certificates, utilizing trust anchor lists to establish trust relationships across disjoint hierarchical trees. End-entities receive a set of public keys as trust anchors, allowing trust derivation in leaf nodes across different trees, as demonstrated in browser trust models.

## Model V: Decentralized CA Trust (Enterprise PKI Model)
Also known as network or mesh PKI architecture, this model positions bottom-level CAs in control, emphasizing trust in the closest CA in a trust graph. It supports complex trust graphs including cross-certificates, peer relationships, and various network topologies, with a focus on administrative and user comprehensibility.

## Motivation of Enterprise PKI Model
The section provides insights into the practical, incremental development of PKIs within enterprises, highlighting the bottom-up building approach. Examples include cross-certifying subsidiaries and managing trust relationships within a single enterprise, discussing the implications and configurations required for secure communications.

## Model VI: User-Control Trust Model (Web of Trust)
This model removes formal CAs from the equation, placing all trust responsibilities on end-users. Users act as their own CAs, make trust decisions, and establish ad hoc trust graphs. This approach, prominent in PGP models for secure email, demands a high level of technical involvement from users.
