# Chapter 8: Public-Key Certificate Management and Use Cases

## Overview
This chapter delves into the realm of public-key certificate management, exploring its role within the broader landscape of public-key infrastructure (PKI). It provides a comprehensive examination of the mechanisms, architectures, and challenges associated with certificate management. Two principal use cases, namely TLS (for secure browser-server communications) and end-to-end encrypted email, are explored in detail. The chapter also touches upon additional applications including SSH, IPsec, DNSSEC, and trusted computing, which are discussed in subsequent chapters.

## Certificate Management and PKI
Public-key infrastructure is a crucial element in maintaining secure communications and data integrity in distributed systems. It lays the foundation for robust access control to remote computing resources and data services. Additionally, it plays a pivotal role in authorization processes such as data modification, storage, and remote command execution. 

Authentication is often the first step in these processes, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to certain functionalities or data. In cases where passwords are utilized for remote authentication, they typically traverse a secure channel. This security is established using cryptographic keys that ensure both the confidentiality and integrity of the data, whether it is in transit or at rest.

## Key Management
A significant aspect of PKI is key management, which encompasses a variety of mechanisms and protocols aimed at the secure and convenient distribution of cryptographic keys. This process is not limited to the management of session keys (as discussed in Chapter 4) but also extends to the management of public keys and their associated long-term private keys.

## Conclusion
In summary, this chapter provides a thorough exploration of public-key certificate management and its integration with public-key infrastructure. It highlights the critical role of PKI in securing distributed systems, emphasizing the importance of authentication, authorization, and key management in maintaining secure access to remote resources and data. The chapter also presents real-world applications of these concepts through the examination of TLS and encrypted email, providing readers with a practical understanding of how these principles are applied in everyday scenarios.
