# 7.3: Virus Anti-detection and Worm-Spreading Techniques

## Introduction
This section meticulously discusses various strategies and tactics employed by computer viruses and network worms, focusing on their efforts to evade detection and enhance their spread across networks. 

## Part A: Anti-Detection Strategies for Viruses

### 1. Encrypted Body Virus:
- **Overview**: Viruses of this type encrypt their bodies to camouflage their presence.
- **Execution Mechanism**: They require decryption before they can execute. A small, unchanged decryptor is responsible for this decryption.
- **Detection Challenge**: The static nature of the decryptor makes it vulnerable to string-matching virus detectors. However, the encryption key, stored within the decryptor, can be altered with each new infection, adding a layer of complexity to the detection process.
- **Classification**: This is a basic form of hiding, employing fixed mappings or symmetric-key encryption.

### 2. Polymorphic Virus:
- **Overview**: This type of virus takes encryption a step further.
- **Unique Mechanism**: It not only encrypts its body but also frequently changes its decryptor portion using a mutation engine.
- **Variations**: 
  - *Weak Form*: Utilizes a pool of decryptors, selecting a different one for each infection.
  - *Strong Form*: Employs a mini-compiler to create numerous variations of the decryptor.
- **Detection Post-Decryption**: Despite these complexities, once decrypted, the static body of the virus becomes vulnerable to string-matching techniques.
- **Emulation as a Solution**: Anti-virus tools often run executables in emulators to catch the virus post-decryption.

### 3. Virus with External Decryption Key:
- **Overview**: This category of viruses stores the decryption key outside of the virus body.
- **Variations in Key Storage**: The key might be in a different file, on another machine, or generated on-the-fly based on host-specific data.
- **Complexity in Analysis**: Such external storage of the key adds a layer of difficulty for anyone attempting manual analysis of an infected file.

### 4. Metamorphic Virus:
- **Overview**: These are sophisticated viruses that rewrite their own code with each infection.
- **Lack of Encryption**: They do not use encryption and, therefore, lack a decryptor portion.
- **Code Mutation**: Both the virus body and the mutation engine are subject to mutation.
- **Utilization of Host Resources**: Some sophisticated metamorphic viruses carry source code and may use compiler tools on the host machine.

## Part B: Concealing Infection Signs
In addition to hiding their code, viruses may also aim to hide signs of their presence, such as changes to file system attributes or the existence of certain processes. Techniques related to this are covered in Section 7.4, associated with rootkits.

## Part C: The Necessity of Reverse Engineering

### Overview
- **Importance**: As malware authors employ various obfuscation and encryption techniques, reverse engineering becomes a critical skill.
- **Applications**: It is vital for understanding malware, identifying it, and developing tools for its removal.

### Tools and Skills Required
- **Expertise in Machine Language**: A deep understanding is necessary.
- **Use of Specific Tools**: Interactive debuggers, disassemblers, decompilers, and emulation tools are essential.

## Part D: Auto-Rooters

### Definition and Mechanism
- **Overview**: Auto-rooters are malicious programs designed to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities in network services.
- **Goal**: To obtain unauthorized access, install rootkits, and possibly enroll the system in a botnet.

### User-Friendliness and Defense
- **Ease of Use**: They often have simple "point-and-click" interfaces.
- **Defense Strategies**: Include disabling unused services, updating software, using firewalls, and employing anti-virus tools.

## Part E: Localized and Context-Aware Scanning for Worms

### Difference in Spreading Mechanisms
- **Overview**: Unlike viruses, worms spread across network devices.
- **Target Selection**: Strategies include random IP address selection or localized scanning for faster propagation within networks.
- **Context-Aware Strategies**: Utilize information related to the current host to find populated addresses.

## Part F: Strategies for Faster Worm Spreading

### 1. Hit-List Scanning
- **Purpose**: To speed up the initial spreading phase.
- **Mechanism**: Utilizes a pre-compiled list of potentially vulnerable hosts.

### 2. Permutation Scanning
- **Goal**: To reduce redundant contacts with already infected machines.
- **Ordering**: Addresses are scanned in a fixed order to avoid re-infection attempts.

### 3. Internet-Scale Hit-Lists
- **Comprehensiveness**: Aims to pre-identify vulnerable servers across the entire internet.
- **Historical Context**: When proposed in 2002, this included a list of 12.6 million servers.

## Part G: The 1988 Internet Worm (Morris Worm)

### Overview and Impact
- **Historical Significance**: This was a major incident demonstrating the potential of network worms.
- **Scale of Infection**: It infected 10% of internet devices, causing widespread outages and demonstrating a powerful denial of service capability.

### Mechanism of Action
- **Initial Infection**: The malware made network connections to download further components.
- **Stealth and Evasion**: It took steps to hide itself, exploiting software vulnerabilities and abusing trusted remote logins.

### Conclusion
The Morris Worm served as a wake-up call, underscoring the need for robust network security measures and preemptive action against potential network threats.
