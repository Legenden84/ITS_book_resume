# 7.2 Viruses and worms

## Definition: Virus
A computer virus, as defined by Fred Cohen, is a self-replicating program that infects other programs or files by embedding a copy of itself, which may be evolved, into them. It relies on human action for cross-machine spread, such as opening an email attachment or using external storage media.

#### Computer virus
```c
loop
    remain dormant until host runs();
    propagate with user help();
    if trigger condition true() then
        run payload();
endloop; 
```

#### Computer worm
```c
loop
    propagate over network();
    if trigger condition true() then
        run payload();
endloop
```

## Generic structure
The structure of a virus includes:
1. **Dormancy Phase**: The virus remains inactive until the host program is executed.
2. **Propagation Mechanism**: It describes how the virus spreads.
3. **Trigger Condition**: It determines when the virus's payload activates.
4. **Payload Delivery**: This is the harmful activity performed by the virus, varying in severity from benign to extremely destructive.

## How worms differ
Worms are distinct from viruses in that they:
- I: Spread automatically without human intervention.
- II: Propagate over networks using network protocols.
- III: Exploit software vulnerabilities like buffer overflows instead of relying on user actions or software features.

## Email-based malware
This type of malware spreads via email by exploiting client features and user interaction, often using social engineering. It extracts targets from the victim's address book and employs mass-mailing strategies.

## Magic, mawlware and privileges
Malware, which includes viruses and worms, operates with the same capabilities as regular software. Their potential to cause damage is significantly amplified when running with elevated privileges.

## Program file viruses
Virus code can be inserted into executables through various methods:
(a) **Shift and prepend**: Moving the original file content and adding the virus code at the beginning.
(b) **Append**: Attaching the virus at the end of the file.
(c) **Overwrite from top**: Replacing the host file from the start, which destroys the original program.
(d) **Overwrite from an interior point**: Aiming to evade detection by virus scanners that only check the start and end of files.

## Virus: Alternate definition
Viruses can also replicate without embedding into other programs by utilizing command shells, scripts, and certain environmental variables. Companion viruses are a prime example.

## Brain Virus (1986)
Identified as the first PC virus, it spread through infected floppy disks and altered the boot sector code, occasionally damaging the file allocation table (FAT) and files contained within.

## CIH Chernobyl Virus (1998-2000)
The CIH virus inflicted damage on hardware by overwriting hard disk sectors and corrupting BIOS firmware, rendering affected computers inoperative. It uniquely inserted itself into unused spaces within files, disrupting anti-virus detection methods.

## Data file viruses and realted malware
Data documents, unlike simple text files, can contain executable scripts, which when opened can exploit vulnerabilities or spread malware through shared documents.

## Virus detection: Undecidable problem
It is theoretically impossible for any program to detect all viruses, a fact demonstrated through a proof by contradiction using the hypothetical perfect virus detector program, leading to a logical paradox.

## What this means
Despite the theoretical impossibility of creating a perfect virus detector, in practice, antivirus software can still detect many viruses through continuous updates and improvements, engaging in an ongoing battle with virus developers.

## Virus detection in practice
Antivirus programs utilize various detection methods:
- **Signature-based detection**: Identifies malware by unique byte-sequences.
- **Allowlist approach**: Employs known-good hashes to verify the integrity of programs.
- **Behavioral detection**: Monitors for sequences of actions indicative of malicious behavior.
These methods are effective against known threats but face challenges with new, unidentified "zero-day" malware.
