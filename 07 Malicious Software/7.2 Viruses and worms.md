# 7.2 Viruses and Worms - Detailed Summary

## Introduction
Viruses and worms were among the first types of malware to cause widespread issues, sharing the ability to replicate and spread across different systems. They are distinctive in their propagation methods, employing innovative strategies to increase their instances and reach multiple machines.

## Viruses: Definition and Characteristics
According to Fred Cohen, a computer virus is defined as a program that can infiltrate other programs or files, modifying them to include a possibly evolved copy of itself. A virus typically replicates within the same machine, spreading to various programs or files, and can also move across different machines through human actions like inserting a USB flash drive or opening an email attachment.

**Generic Structure of a Virus:**
1. **Dormancy**: The virus remains inactive until the host program is executed.
2. **Propagation**: The virus spreads to other files or systems.
3. **Trigger Condition**: Determines when the virusâ€™s malicious payload is executed.
4. **Payload**: The harmful actions performed by the virus, ranging from mild to severe impacts.

Viruses are designed to embed themselves in a host program or file containing executable content, ensuring their code is executed when the host is processed.

## How Worms Differ from Viruses
Worms are a different class of malware with three main distinguishing features:
1. They propagate automatically and continuously, without requiring user interaction.
2. They spread over networks, leveraging network protocols and daemons, unlike viruses which require a host program.
3. They exploit software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, while viruses tend to manipulate software features or rely on social engineering.

These properties make worms capable of spreading more quickly than viruses, potentially leading to network overloads and denial of service conditions.

## Email-Based Malware
This category includes malware that combines characteristics of both viruses and worms, spreading through email attachments, file infections, and leveraging email client features. They typically require user interaction, such as opening an email or reading a message, and may use social engineering tactics to deceive the user.

## Malware and Privileges
Malware, like any other software, operates with certain privileges. Its functionality depends on the privileges it has, with elevated privileges allowing it to perform more complex and potentially damaging actions.

**Exercise (Malware Privileges):** Reflect on whether malware controls its own privileges, considering the relationship between root privileges and kernel mode.

## Program File Viruses
Most viruses target executable program files, employing various strategies for code insertion, including shifting and prepending, appending to the file's end, or overwriting parts of the host file. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, impacting how easily the virus can be detected and removed.

**Alternate Definition of Viruses:** Using command shells, scripts, and environment variables, viruses can replicate without embedding themselves in other programs, exemplified by companion viruses.

## Historical Viruses
### Brain Virus (1986)
The Brain virus, regarded as the first PC virus, was a boot sector virus primarily spreading through floppy disks. It occasionally damaged the file allocation table, leading to file loss, but was not overtly malicious.

### CIH Chernobyl Virus (1998-2000)
The CIH, or Chernobyl virus, was highly destructive, targeting Windows 95/98/ME systems. It demonstrated the potential for malware to cause hardware damage, overwriting critical disk sectors and attempting to write to the system BIOS firmware, rendering affected machines inoperable.

## Data File Viruses and Related Malware
These viruses target modern data documents that contain embedded scripts and markup instructions, exploiting vulnerabilities in associated applications and spreading through file sharing and common templates.

## Virus Detection: An Undecidable Problem
Proving the impossibility of creating a program that can detect all viruses, we demonstrate a logical contradiction using a hypothetical perfect virus detector. However, this does not mean efforts to detect viruses are futile; while it's impossible to detect all viruses, it is feasible to detect many.

## Virus Detection in Practice
Detecting malware involves identifying unique byte-sequences or signatures, with tools like anti-virus programs scanning executables before they are run. Detection mechanisms include denylist-based (for known malware) and allowlist-based (for known good software) approaches, with additional strategies such as behavioral signatures and emulated environments to facilitate detection.
