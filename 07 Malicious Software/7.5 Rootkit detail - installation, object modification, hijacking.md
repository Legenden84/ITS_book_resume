# 7.5: Rootkit detail: installation, object modification, hijacking

## 1. Hijacking System Calls: A Deep Dive
Rootkits, especially kernel rootkits, exhibit a profound ability to manipulate and hijack system calls, an integral part of their modus operandi. This section delineates the nuances of how applications, operating in user mode, interact with the kernel through system calls, facilitated by OS services and shared library utilities. Rootkits capitalize on this interaction, altering entries in dispatch tables (a collection of function pointers, also referred to as a service address table or a dispatch table) to redirect system calls to malicious code.

This malicious code, often termed as the 'hook', is positioned to execute in lieu of or in addition to the legitimate system code. The rootkit may choose to process the results post-execution, thereby manipulating the outcome of system calls. This technique, broadly referred to as 'hooking', is not inherently malicious and finds applications in legitimate scenarios, such as in the operations of antivirus software. The section highlights three prominent methods of system call hijacking:
1. Altering dispatch table entries to point to rootkit code.
2. Overwriting the code of targeted system calls directly.
3. Replacing an entire service address table with a substitute, redirecting all system calls.

## 2. Function Hooking in Windows: SSDT and IAT
The Windows operating system is not immune to the threats posed by rootkits, with function hooking being a prevalent method of attack. The System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) and the Import Address Table (IAT) are focal points for such attacks in kernel and user space respectively. While the SSDT is employed for dispatching kernel services, the IAT is instrumental for shared libraries in user space, serving as the primary dispatch table and hence, a prime target for user-space rootkits.

In contrast to the Unix environment, where syscall interfaces are well-documented and accessed through C library wrapper functions, Windows operates under a cloak of obscurity. Syscalls are accessed via the NTAPI/Native API, dispatched via SSDT, creating an environment susceptible to rootkit attacks.

## 3. Inline Hooking: A Sophisticated Approach
Inline hooking stands out as a sophisticated and intricate method of system manipulation. It circumvents the limitations of dispatch table hooking, introducing detour patching to embed detour and trampoline functions. This methodology facilitates extensive preprocessing and postprocessing around a target function, providing the rootkit with substantial control and manipulation capabilities.

However, its sophistication does not render it undetectable. While dispatch table hooking is vulnerable to detection through a simple cross-check of table addresses, inline hooking is susceptible to integrity checks. By hashing the executable code of the target function and comparing it to a known-good hash, inline hooks can be uncovered.

## 4. Kernel Object Modification and Pruning Reports: A Dual-Faceted Strategy
Rootkits employ a dual-faceted strategy to conceal their presence, manipulating kernel objects and system call results. Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) entails altering kernel data structures directly, removing traces of the rootkit. Examples include escalating process privileges, modifying lists of files, modules, or running processes.

On the other hand, postprocessing system call results allows the rootkit to intercept and alter the output of legitimate system calls, effectively pruning reports to exclude any rootkit-related information. This is achieved through a combination of hooking, preprocessing, and postprocessing.

## 5. The Installation Conundrum: Multiple Avenues
The installation of rootkits, particularly kernel rootkits, can be achieved through various means:
1. **Standard Kernel Module Installation**: Superusers, despite their inability to access kernel memory directly, can install kernel modules. Rootkits exploit this by masquerading as legitimate modules or tricking superusers into loading malicious modules.
2. **Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities**: Buffer overflows or parsing errors in kernel code can provide an avenue for rootkits to infiltrate the system.
3. **Manipulating the Boot Process**: Altering the kernel post-loading but pre-execution, possibly through a rogue boot loader.
4. **Modifying Swapped Data**: Kernel memory swapped to disk can be altered if accessible by user processes, affecting kernel integrity upon reloading.
5. **Utilizing Physical Address Space Interfaces**: Hardware devices with Direct Memory Access (DMA) capabilities can be exploited to directly alter kernel memory.

## 6. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs): A Gateway for Rootkits
LKMs serve as a potent tool for rootkits, allowing them to extend or retract kernel functionality dynamically. They facilitate the introduction of malicious code into the OS kernel, operating as executable components that can be managed while the system is running.

## 7. The Crucial Role of Linking and Loading
Understanding the mechanics of compiling, linking, and loading is imperative for comprehending how rootkits integrate with a system. The compiler converts source code to machine code, resulting in an object file. The linker then combines these object files into an executable, which the loader subsequently moves into main memory, performing address relocation if necessary. Loaders, especially those with dynamic linkers, play a crucial role in loading executables and linking shared libraries.

## 8. User Mode Rootkits: A Distinct Breed
User mode rootkits operate in the address space of user processes, intercepting resource enumeration APIs to filter out malicious activity from reports. Unlike their kernel counterparts, changes made by user mode rootkits are isolated to the affected application, with shared library alterations being the exception.

## 9. Safeguarding Secrets and Local Data: The Imperative of Encryption
The proliferation of client-side malware underscores the importance of encrypting locally stored data. Techniques such as encrypted filesystems and disk encryption, whether software or hardware-supported, are paramount for ensuring data security on disk storage.
