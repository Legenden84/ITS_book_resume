# 7.8 Social Engineering and Categorizing Malware: In-Depth Analysis

## Engaging with Social Engineering and User-Enabled Malware Installs

### **Tricking Users into Malware Installation**
Social engineering attacks manipulate users into downloading and installing malware, contrasting with silent installations. The infamous Happy99 email worm-virus of 1999 is an early example, convincing users to execute an attached file. Modern operating systems’ user-friendly interfaces sometimes hide filename extensions, unintentionally aiding these attacks by concealing executable file indicators like .exe. Furthermore, double-clicking any file in such systems can transfer execution privileges, whether it's opening an executable directly or running an associated program for a data file. This represents a user-enabled execution risk.

### **Email Clients and HTML: A Vulnerable Combination**
The evolution of email from text-only to supporting HTML and embedded scripting (e.g., JavaScript) opened up avenues for malware execution, particularly when viewing emails in clients like Microsoft Outlook, which initially ran embedded JavaScript. Even preview panes, showing part of an email without fully opening it, could trigger malicious script execution. Modern email clients have since disabled embedded script running and require explicit user action to load external images.

## Categorizing Malware: Objectives and Technical Properties

### **Malware Objectives: What Drives the Attack?**
1. **Damaging Host and Data**: Intentionally destroying or corrupting files, or disrupting machine operations.
2. **Data Theft**: Stealing sensitive corporate or personal information, or login credentials for fraudulent activities or mass sale.
3. **Direct Financial Gain**: Deceiving users into purchases, extorting via ransomware, or renting out malware services.
4. **Ongoing Surveillance**: Covertly recording user activities via device microphones, cameras, or keystroke tracking.
5. **Spreading Malware**: Using compromised machines to further distribute malware.
6. **Controlling Resources**: Installing code for later execution or backdoor access, utilizing the device’s capabilities for various malicious purposes, such as botnet activities or as a relay point for further attacks.

### **Malware Technical Characteristics: How Does it Operate?**
a) **Self-Replication**: Assessing if the malware breeds on its own, distinct from mechanisms like drive-by download websites.
b) **Host Dependency**: Determining if it requires a host program to function, akin to a parasite.
c) **Stealth**: Evaluating its measures to evade detection and conceal its true nature.
d) **Infection Vector**: Identifying how it spreads, whether automatically over networks or requiring user interaction, and if the latter, whether it employs social engineering.
e) **Insider Aid**: Considering if it leverages privileged internal access.
f) **Persistence**: Determining if its presence is transient, like active content on a webpage, or persistent, activating on startup.
