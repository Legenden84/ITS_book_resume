# 9.4 Same-origin Policy (DOM SOP) Detailed Summary

## Introduction
The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a fundamental security principle in web development, aimed at establishing a stringent isolation between different web documents. It ensures that a script or document from one origin does not gain unauthorized access to or manipulate the content of a document from another origin. This policy is pivotal in maintaining the integrity of web interactions and is rooted in the ISOLATED-COMPARTMENTS principle, denoted as P5.

## Core Motivation
Imagine a scenario where a browser indiscriminately loads HTML documents from two different domains: host1 and host2, without any restrictions to segregate their content. This could lead to a situation where a JavaScript file from host1 might access or modify data associated with host2. This becomes a severe security concern, especially when host1 is a malicious site, and host2 is a trusted site like a bank. Therefore, establishing a set of rules to mitigate such risks is crucial. However, an overly restrictive policy might hinder legitimate interactions between subdomains of the same domain or could disrupt the internet's advertising model that relies heavily on embedding third-party advertisements. Thus, a balanced approach is necessary.

## DOM SOP Implementation
The DOM SOP is implemented with a set of rules specifically tailored for HTML documents and scripts:
1. A base HTML document is given an origin based on the URI used to retrieve it.
2. Scripts and images inherit their origin from the HTML documents that initiate their load, not the origin of the host they are retrieved from.
3. Generally, scripts are permitted to access content that shares the same assigned origin.

The objective is to place content from different hosts into distinct protection domains, preventing any unauthorized interactions. However, achieving these isolation goals is a complex task, given the competing interests of security and resource sharing utility.

## Origin Triplet Definition
To precisely compare two web origins, the SOP relies on an origin triplet, composed of the scheme, host, and port. The host refers to the fully qualified domain name, and the scheme represents the document-fetching protocol. Based on this, a script in an HTML document can access resources assigned the same origin but is barred from interacting with content or DOM properties from a different origin. To ensure separation of content from different origins, distinct windows or frames should be used.

## Relaxing SOP with document.domain
Developers facing overly restrictive SOP rules can alter the `document.domain` property to facilitate interactions between windows or frames from peer subdomains. This approach, while convenient, is viewed as insecure since it broadens access to all subdomains of the specified suffix, potentially leading to unintended access.

## SOP for Cookies
In the realm of HTTP cookies, a different variation of SOP is applied, where the port number is not considered in defining an origin. Here, cookies returned to a server are available across all ports of that server. This unique SOP for cookies is complemented by additional security attributes like Secure and HttpOnly.

## SOP for Plugin-Specific Active Content
Beyond the foundational role of scripts in HTML, browsers have historically supported active content for specific plugins, each adhering to its own origin policy. These plugins, however, have been prone to security exploits due to their direct access to local OS interfaces and lackluster security policies.

## SOP's Role in AJAX
SOP plays a critical role in Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX), a technology enabling rich interactive web applications. It ensures that asynchronous HTTP requests made by scripts are restricted to the origin server, bolstering the security of ongoing browser-server communications.

Through the application of these principles and rules, the Same-Origin Policy stands as a bulwark, safeguarding the web ecosystem from potential threats while balancing the need for interactive and dynamic web content.
