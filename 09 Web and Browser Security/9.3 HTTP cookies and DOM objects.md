# 9.3 HTTP Cookies and DOM Objects: Summary

## DOM (Document Object Model)
- HTML documents are represented internally as a hierarchy of objects using the DOM.
- The `window` object represents the browser window or frame displaying an HTML document.
- The HTML content is accessed via `window.document`, with the `window.location` property holding the document's URL components.
- DOM serves as an API for JavaScript to interact and manipulate web page content, updating the display based on changes to the DOM objects.

## Browser Cookies
- HTTP is stateless; cookies are a mechanism to maintain state across web sessions.
- Cookies are size-limited data strings set by the server and returned by the browser in subsequent requests.
- Session cookies are temporary and live in browser memory, while persistent cookies have extended lifetimes.
- Multiple cookies can be set by a server in a single response, with each cookie having a unique name.
- Cookies are sent back to the server based on their scope attributes, which include Domain and Path.

## Cookie Attributes
- `Max-Age`/`Expires`: defines the cookie's lifetime, creating a persistent cookie if set.
- `Domain`: expands the cookie’s scope to a superset of hosts, restricted for security reasons.
- `Path`: limits the cookie to specific server pages or paths.
- `Secure`: dictates that the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS.
- `HttpOnly`: restricts the cookie’s accessibility to only HTTP, blocking JavaScript access.

## Additional Details
- `document.cookie` in the DOM API retrieves all cookies for the current document.
- New cookies with the same name, Domain, and Path attributes as existing cookies will replace the old ones.
- The `navigator.cookieEnabled` property indicates whether persistent cookies are enabled.
- Subdomains have distinct cookies from higher-level domains.
- Section 9.6 provides further discussion on cookie security.
