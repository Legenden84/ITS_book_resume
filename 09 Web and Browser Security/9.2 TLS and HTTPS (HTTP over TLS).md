# 9.2 TLS and HTTPS: Detailed Summary

## Introduction
HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is vital for securing web traffic, operating via a TLS (Transport Layer Security) channel set up over a TCP connection, allowing HTTP data to be transmitted securely. The process involves two primary layers: the Handshake layer for setting up parameters, and the Record layer for protecting application data.

## Handshake Layer
The Handshake layer is critical for establishing a secure connection, consisting of three main parts:
1. **Key Exchange**: This finalizes all cryptographic parameters, setting the stage for a secure connection.
2. **Server Parameters**: The server finalizes all other options and parameters during this phase.
3. **Integrity and Authentication**: This ensures the authentication of the server to the client and optionally vice versa.

Once the Key Exchange is complete, the subsequent parts can be encrypted, enhancing security.

## Key Exchange (TLS 1.3)
The Key Exchange in TLS 1.3 aims to establish a master key, a shared secret known to both client and server. This involves three options:
1. **Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE)**: Uses fresh exponentials, ensuring forward secrecy.
2. **Pre-shared Key (PSK)**: Utilizes a long-term secret established previously, lacking forward secrecy on its own.
3. **PSK combined with DHE**: A combination that provides the benefits of both, ensuring forward secrecy.

## Server Authentication (TLS 1.3)
Server to client authentication can be based on a PSK or digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA, or EdDSA). Client-to-server authentication is optional and often unused in HTTPS. However, if utilized, it requires a client signature for validation.

## Encryption and Integrity (TLS 1.3)
TLS 1.3 provides a secure channel integrating key establishment and server authentication. This ensures not only confidentiality but also extends authentication to subsequent data transfers, utilizing Authenticated Encryption (AE) algorithms.

## Session Resumption (TLS 1.3)
TLS 1.3 enables faster setup for subsequent sessions through session tickets, allowing encrypted HTTP requests to be sent more quickly. This is known as 0-RTT resumption, contributing to improved efficiency in secure communication.

## Example: STARTTLS
STARTTLS represents a strategy used by various Internet protocols to upgrade a regular connection to a TLS-secured one without changing ports. This is distinct from HTTPS, which operates on a separate port from HTTP. STARTTLS is considered opportunistic, providing protection primarily against passive monitoring.
