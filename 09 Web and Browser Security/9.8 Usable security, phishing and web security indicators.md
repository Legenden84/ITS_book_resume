# 9.8 Usable Security, Phishing, and Web Security Indicators

## Introduction
This section explores the intricate relationship between usability and security, emphasizing the need for "usable security." It highlights the significance of this concept in areas like user authentication and secure email, expanding the discussion to include phishing attacks and browser security indicators. The role of users’ mental models and the implementation of proper design principles are also discussed.

## Phishing Attacks
Phishing attacks deceive users into visiting fraudulent websites, aiming to steal sensitive information like banking credentials, personal information, or credit card details. Various tactics are employed, including misleading links, browser redirection, spear phishing (targeting specific individuals), and typosquatting (exploiting common misspellings of legitimate URLs). The attacks exploit users’ incorrect mental models and leverage visual deception, limited technical understanding, and lack of attention to security details.

## Mental Models and Security
Users’ mental models, their understanding of how systems work, significantly influence their security-related decisions. Phishing attacks manipulate these models through social engineering and visual deception, taking advantage of users’ limited technical knowledge and attention to detail.

## Enablers of Phishing
Phishing thrives on user deception and technical ignorance. Visual deception is easily achieved through misleading UI elements. Users are also easily fooled by deceptive URLs, domain and subdomain confusion, and a lack of understanding of the difference between browser-controlled elements and site-controlled content.

## Phishing and Certificate Grades
Users typically do not understand web certificates and their varying levels of validation, such as DV, OV, and EV certificates. HTTPS usage does not necessarily indicate a legitimate site, and the distinctions between certificate types are often not clear to end-users, leading to confusion and potential security risks.

## Defenses Against Phishing
Primary defenses include removing phishing site links through spam filters, domain filtering in browsers, and user education. However, these measures are not foolproof, and challenges remain, particularly with transient phishing sites and the continuous evolution of social engineering tactics.

## Identity Theft
Phishing attacks directly enable identity theft, allowing attackers to acquire new credentials in the victim's name, leading to serious legal and financial repercussions.

## Security Indicators in Browsers
Browsers employ various HTTPS-related security indicators to inform users of potential risks. These include padlock icons, HTTPS prefixes, and various visual cues for different certificate grades. However, attackers exploit users’ confusion over these indicators, and frequent design changes contribute to this confusion.

## HTTPS: Encryption vs. Identification and Safety
While HTTPS ensures encrypted communication, it does not guarantee the legitimacy of the connected site. The browser’s trust model and certificate validation processes are explored, highlighting the challenge of confirming a site’s identity and the user’s intended destination.

## Summary and Challenges with EV Certificates
Browsers offer several security-related services, including HTTPS encryption, certificate validation, and bad-site warnings. However, the actual benefits delivered to users by EV certificates remain questionable due to challenges in user understanding and UI design. The challenges of conveying varying degrees of assurance from different certificate classes are also discussed.

## Positive vs. Negative Security Indicators
There is a movement towards normalizing HTTPS and highlighting the insecurity of HTTP, marked by changes in visual indicators in browsers. This includes the removal of positive security indicators for HTTPS and the introduction of more prominent negative indicators for non-HTTPS connections.

## Usable Security
The concept of usable security emphasizes the design of secure systems that do not compromise usability. Challenges in this area include designing systems that prevent dangerous errors, building security mechanisms that users find acceptable, providing timely and context-appropriate security education, and conveying reliable security indicators to users.

## Conclusion
The pursuit of usable security demands a balanced approach, considering both technical and human factors. The complexity of phishing attacks and the subtleties of browser security indicators illustrate the challenges in achieving this balance, underscoring the need for continuous improvement in design, education, and technology.
