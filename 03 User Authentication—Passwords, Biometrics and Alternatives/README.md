# Chapter 3: User Authenticationâ€”Passwords, Biometrics and Alternatives

## Summary:

This chapter delves into the intricacies of user authentication, focusing on how individuals authenticate themselves to computer systems, distinguishing it from identification which is about recognizing an identity without an explicit assertion. It covers key authentication methods such as passwords, biometrics, and other alternatives, and explores how they contribute to verifying asserted identities.

Authentication is emphasized as a critical process where supporting evidence is used to validate an asserted identity, typically involving the entry of a username and password. This is in contrast to identification, which is about establishing identity based on available information, like recognizing a criminal in a crowd or matching fingerprints to a database. Authentication, being a one-to-one test (checking the asserted username and fingerprint against stored templates), is highlighted as less complex than identification, which has to deal with a one-to-many scenario, increasing in complexity with the number of candidates.

Furthermore, the chapter underlines that authentication might serve as either an end-goal itself or a means to achieve authorization, which is the process of determining if a particular privilege or access to a resource should be granted. A practical example provided is the requirement for users to enter a password to authorize actions like installing or upgrading software.

Focusing on human-computer interaction for authentication, the chapter leaves machine-to-machine authentication and cryptographic protocols for the subsequent chapter. Among the authentication methods discussed, significant attention is given to passwords, hardware-based tokens, and biometric authentication. Additionally, tools and concepts such as password managers, CAPTCHAs, graphical passwords, and entropy are explored, particularly in the context of their relevance to the security of user-generated passwords.
