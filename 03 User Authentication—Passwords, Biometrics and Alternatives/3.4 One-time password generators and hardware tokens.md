# 3.4 One-time Password Generators and Hardware Tokens: Summary

## **One-Time Passwords (OTPs)**
- **Problem with Static Passwords**: Easily captured and reused by attackers.
- **One-Time Passwords (OTPs)**: Valid for a single use, combating replay attacks.
  - **Distribution Challenge**: How to share OTP lists between the user and verifier.
  - **Methods**:
    - Physical lists of passwords.
    - Generation from a seed using hash functions.

## **OTPs via Mobile Phones**
- OTPs sent to users' mobiles for account access or as a second authentication factor.
- **Security Concern**: SIM swap attacks where attackers trick providers to transfer a victim's number to a new SIM.

## **Lamport Hash Chains for OTPs**
- Generating OTPs from a seed using a hash function.
- Sequence used in reverse, providing distinct passwords for a number of sessions.
- **Pre-play Attacks**: Capturing OTPs for unauthorized use, highlighting the need for careful OTP handling.

## **Passcode Generators**
- Devices or apps generating OTPs based on a user-specific secret and a time-variant parameter (TVP).
- Can be used as a second authentication factor alongside static passwords.
- **Benefits**: Locally generated OTPs avoid SMS interception risks.

## **Hardware Tokens**
- Devices holding cryptographic secrets for generating digital tokens in authentication protocols.
- Examples: USB keys, smart cards.
- Part of the "what you have" authentication category.

## **User Authentication Categories**
- **Knowledge-Based**: Passwords, PINs.
- **What You Have**: Hardware tokens, devices with secrets.
- **What You Are**: Biometrics.
- **Where You Are**: Location-based authentication.

## **Multiple Factors Authentication (MFA)**
- Using more than one authentication method, ideally from different categories, for enhanced security.
- **Example**: Static password as a first factor, with a second factor like a biometric or OTP.
- **Considerations**: MFA adds security but also usability costs.

## **Complementary Factors and Properties**
- Choosing factors with complementary properties to balance security and usability.
- **Example**: Hardware token avoids memory burden but adds the need to carry the device.

## **Silent Authentication Checks**
- Using implicit means like IP-address checks and browser cookies for background authentication.
- Offers usability advantages as long as it doesnâ€™t lead to false rejections.

## **Factors for Primary Authentication and Recovery**
- Evaluating whether a second factor is strong enough for stand-alone use.
- Recovery methods might not be convenient for primary use but are vital for account security.
