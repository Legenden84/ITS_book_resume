# 3.7 Summary: CAPTCHAs (humans-in-the-loop) vs. Automated Attacks

CAPTCHAs serve as a security measure to differentiate humans from automated bots, especially on free web services where bots may attempt to create numerous accounts for spamming or other malicious activities. They present tasks easy for humans but challenging for bots, involving distorted text, audio, image recognition, or cognitive challenges.

## Online Guessing and CAPTCHAs
To mitigate online guessing attacks, servers can limit login attempts, but this risks locking out legitimate users. A better strategy is making login guesses more costly by requiring a CAPTCHA (Automated Turing Test) for each password attempt. However, this can inconvenience legitimate users.

### Pinkas-Sander Login Protocol
This protocol only requires a CAPTCHA for a fraction of login attempts, mainly when a user logs in from an unfamiliar device or after incorrect password entries. This balances security and user convenience, ensuring legitimate users aren't overly burdened while making attacks more costly.

### Technical Details
The protocol ensures that requiring a CAPTCHA doesn't directly reveal correct password entries, adhering to the open-design principle. The decision to require a CAPTCHA is deterministic, preventing attackers from circumventing it by retrying the same login credentials.

## The Future of CAPTCHAs
The effectiveness of CAPTCHAs is uncertain as automated solvers improve and user tolerance for complexity decreases. New approaches, like Google's reCAPTCHA, aim to analyze user behavior for bot detection, reducing the need for direct user interaction with CAPTCHAs.
