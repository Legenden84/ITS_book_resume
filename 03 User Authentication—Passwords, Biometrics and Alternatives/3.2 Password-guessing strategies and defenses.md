# 3.2 Password-guessing strategies and defenses

## Online Password Guessing and Rate-limiting
Online password guessing attacks target publicly accessible, password-protected servers. Attackers, whether human or automated programs, submit sequential userid-password pairs to the server, leveraging any obtained valid userids. The server indicates the success or failure of each attempt. A defense mechanism against this is rate-limiting, where a maximum number of incorrect login attempts are allowed within a set time window, potentially locking out legitimate users but enhancing security. The drawback of potential lockouts can be mitigated using account recovery methods. Additionally, increasing delays after successive incorrect login attempts is a variation of this defense.

## Offline Password Guessing
In offline attacks, attackers access the system's password hash file, allowing them to verify password guesses without interacting with the server. This means that the attack's speed is only limited by the attacker's computational resources. Iterated hashing or password stretching can mitigate the effectiveness of offline attacks, requiring the attacker to compute a hash multiple times before verification, increasing the computational cost of each guess.

## Password Salting
Salting involves adding a random value to a password before hashing, making precomputed dictionary attacks more challenging and ensuring that identical passwords result in different hashes in the system. However, if the salt value is available to an attacker, it does not increase the difficulty of on-the-fly attacks.

## Pepper (Secret Salt)
Pepper is a secret value added to the password before hashing, not stored in the system. This approach aims to slow down attacks, requiring the system to sequentially try all possible pepper values during verification. This method can be combined with regular salting and iterated hashing.

## Specialized Password-Hashing Functions
The development of specialized password-hashing functions, like Argon2, bcrypt, and scrypt, aims to slow down offline guessing attacks, which have been expedited by fast hash functions and the advent of powerful computational tools like GPUs and FPGAs. These functions are designed to be computationally expensive, making them "GPU-unfriendly."

## System-Assigned Passwords and Brute-Force Guessing
System-assigned passwords maximize the difficulty of password guessing, requiring attackers to engage in brute-force attacks. However, this approach sacrifices usability as users tend to struggle with remembering complex, randomly generated passwords, making this method unpopular in modern applications.

## Probability of Guessing Success
The probability of successfully guessing a password can be calculated, providing a means to evaluate the vulnerability of a system. This is especially straightforward for system-assigned passwords, where the password space is well-defined, and guessing strategies are limited to brute-force attempts.

## User-Chosen Passwords and Skewed Distributions
User-chosen passwords present a different challenge as their distribution is highly skewed, with some passwords being significantly more popular than others. Attackers exploit this by prioritizing guesses based on password popularity.

## Password Denylists and Proactive Password Cracking
Denylisting popular passwords and employing proactive password cracking are additional strategies to counter password-guessing attacks. Denylists prevent users from choosing common passwords, and proactive cracking involves regularly checking user passwords against potential attacks to ensure their robustness.

In summary, this section delves into various password-guessing strategies and the corresponding defenses. Online and offline guessing attacks pose significant threats, mitigated through rate-limiting, iterated hashing, and salting. Specialized password-hashing functions further protect against offline attacks. System-assigned passwords, while secure, are impractical due to their usability issues. Calculating the probability of guessing success provides a quantitative means of assessing security, while the skewed distribution of user-chosen passwords necessitates additional defenses like denylisting and proactive cracking.
