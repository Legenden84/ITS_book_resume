# 3.3 Account Recovery and Secret Questions Detailed Summary

Account recovery mechanisms are indispensable in password-based authentication systems, addressing the prevalent issue of forgotten passwords. However, it is important to note that the term "recovery" doesn't imply retrieving the original password, as storing plaintext passwords on servers is against best practices. Instead, the focus is on helping users regain access to their accounts through various reset methods.

## Recovery Passwords and Recovery Links

A standard procedure for account recovery involves sending a temporary password or a web link to the user’s pre-registered recovery email. This method relies on the assumption that the user still has access to their recovery email account. Upon receiving the temporary password or link, the user can create a new password. This process bypasses the need for the user to enter their existing password, which is a typical requirement for password changes. The temporary password or link essentially acts as a form of authentication, proving the user’s identity.

## Loss of Primary Email Password

Complications arise when the forgotten password is for the user’s primary email account. A common solution is to have a secondary email address registered for recovery purposes. Alternatively, users can pre-register a phone number (either mobile or wireline with text-to-voice capabilities) to receive a one-time recovery code via text message. However, this method introduces a security risk: if an attacker compromises the primary email account, they could potentially gain access to all other accounts associated with that email for password recovery purposes.

## Question-Based Recovery

Secret questions, or challenge questions, serve as another option for account recovery. Typically, these questions aren’t actual secrets; rather, they are standard questions that cue the user to remember specific personal information. During account registration, users select and answer a subset of these questions. Should they forget their password later on, correctly answering the secret questions allows them to set a new password. 

### Usability Aspects

The rationale behind secret questions is that recalling personal information is easier than remembering text passwords. Despite this, recovery through secret questions often fails due to various factors: the significant time lapse between setting and answering the questions, the potential for non-unique or changing answers, and the common issue of users registering false answers and then forgetting them.

### Security Aspects

From a security standpoint, secret questions are considered weak. The answer spaces for these questions tend to be small or highly skewed, making them susceptible to statistical guessing attacks. For targeted attacks, certain answers can be easily found online, such as the name of the high school a person attended. User-created questions can be particularly insecure, and increasing the number of required answers to enhance security often leads to legitimate users being locked out due to incorrect responses. Essentially, if the answers to the secret questions are easier to guess than the primary password, they introduce a significant vulnerability.

## Summary

Secret questions are generally recognized as a suboptimal solution for account recovery, being both less secure and less reliable than other methods. They are especially weak when the answers are stored in plaintext, a common practice to facilitate case-insensitive matching. The consensus among security professionals is that the use of secret questions should be minimized or supplemented with additional authentication methods, such as sending a link to a registered email account or a one-time password to a registered phone.

## Attack Example: Password Reset

The text also provides an example of a password reset attack exploiting secret questions and SMS codes. The attacker controls a website (site-A) and lures victims into registering for free resources or downloads. During registration, the attacker gathers information like the victim’s email address or phone number. Simultaneously, the attacker initiates a password reset for the victim’s account on another site (site-B), which prompts secret questions or sends one-time codes to the victim’s phone. The attacker then forwards these prompts to the victim through site-A, disguising them as part of the registration or download process. The victim unwittingly provides the answers or codes, enabling the attacker to reset the password and take over the account on site-B. This attack showcases the vulnerability of relying solely on secret questions or SMS codes for account recovery, emphasizing the need for more secure recovery methods.
