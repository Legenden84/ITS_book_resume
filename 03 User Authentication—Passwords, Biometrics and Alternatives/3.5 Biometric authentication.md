### 3.5 Biometric Authentication Summary

#### Introduction
Biometric authentication emerges as a response to the inadequacies of passwords and hardware tokens, capitalizing on its user-friendly nature and scalability. Physical biometrics provide “what you are” authentication, while behavioral biometrics offer “what you do” verification. Non-biometric behavioral traits, like geolocation and call patterns, also contribute to authentication.

#### Biometrics as Non-Secrets
Unlike passwords, biometric traits are not secretive; fingerprints and facial features are publicly accessible. The integrity of biometric authentication depends on secure and trusted input channels, making it less suitable for remote authentication. The two-step authentication involving user-to-phone and phone-to-site is an example of circumventing direct remote biometric verification.

#### Enrollment and Verification
Enrollment involves capturing and storing user-specific biometric features, creating a template. For authentication, a fresh sample is compared to this template, determining a match based on a preset threshold.

#### Errors and Trade-Offs
Biometric systems are prone to false accepts (impostor recognized) and false rejects (legitimate user denied). The balance between these errors depends on the threshold and application needs, with higher security demands accepting more false rejects to minimize false accepts.

#### Disadvantages and Risks
Biometric systems demand custom hardware and fallback mechanisms for potential failures and user rejections. Their widespread use risks creating a scenario akin to password reuse, with a compromise in one system potentially endangering others. The irrevocable nature of biometric traits intensifies these risks.

#### Evaluating Biometrics
Assessment involves considering universality, distinguishability, invariance, sampling ease, and other criteria. User acceptance, cost, accuracy, and attack-resistance are crucial for practical implementation.

#### Attacks and Circumvention
The key security question revolves around the system’s vulnerability to impersonation and circumvention, highlighting the need for thorough understanding and defense mechanisms against potential attacks.

#### Authentication vs. Identification
While the focus has been on authentication (verifying a claimed identity), biometrics can also be used for identification (finding an identity from a set), each with its own applications and challenges.

### Conclusion
Biometric authentication presents a user-friendly alternative with significant advantages in scalability and ease of use, but it is not without its challenges and vulnerabilities. Its effectiveness and security depend on proper implementation, understanding of its limitations, and the context of its use.
