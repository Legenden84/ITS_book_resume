# 3.6 Password Managers and Graphical Passwords

## Password Managers
Password managers aid users in handling numerous passwords by storing and retrieving them securely, necessitating the user to remember just one master password. This approach enhances efficiency and usability, reduces memory burden, and bolsters resilience against phishing, especially when the tool associates passwords with specific domains. Despite these advantages, there are pitfalls: master passwords are sometimes weaker than intended, and individual site passwords remain static and potentially guessable. The security improvements are thus not as substantial as one might expect, and new risks are introduced, although usability sees significant enhancement.

### Software Packaging
Password managers can be integrated into operating systems, operate as standalone applications, exist as browser features or plugins, or function as cloud-based services. Some managers offer cross-device synchronization of passwords.

### Password Manager Approaches
1. **Password Wallet/Vault**: Manages a collection of passwords, automatically selecting the required one based on its association with a domain. While it can generate strong, random passwords, in practice, many wallets manage pre-existing, guessable passwords.
2. **Derived Passwords**: Generates site-specific passwords using a master password and additional information. This method provides protection against phishing and increases guessing-resistance.

## Security and Risks
Password managers centralize risk, creating a single point of failure. Threats include capture of the master password, offline guessing, and, for cloud-based services, online guessing. The managed site passwords also remain vulnerable to guessing attacks. However, the reduced need for user input can lower susceptibility to keylogger attacks.

### Risks if Password Manager Fails
Dependency on password managers poses risks; if the tool becomes unavailable, users might lose access to their passwords. No recovery service is typically available for the master password or for passwords used as keys in standalone applications.

### Compatibility with Existing Password Servers
Password wallets are advantageous as they donâ€™t require server-side changes. However, generated passwords might not always meet server-defined policies. Derived-password managers might need to store additional site-specific information to comply with these policies. Auto-filled passwords might be disallowed on some sites.

## Graphical Passwords
Graphical passwords aim to reduce password burden with image-based schemes, potentially increasing security and improving input usability, particularly on mobile and touchscreen devices.

### Classes of Graphical Password Schemes
1. **Pure Recall**: Users reconstruct a pattern or image.
2. **Cued Recall**: Users are assisted by graphical cues to enter their password.
3. **Recognition Schemes**: Users recognize and select familiar images from sets.

### Analysis of Graphical Passwords
Graphical passwords provide minor usability improvements but face challenges with predictable user choices, leading to security concerns. They require significant user training and longer registration and entry times. While they offer some advantages on smartphones, they have not widely displaced text passwords.

In conclusion, while password managers and graphical passwords present novel approaches to managing the plethora of passwords required for modern digital interaction, they are not without their challenges and risks. The balance between usability, security, and convenience continues to be a central theme in their ongoing development and adoption.
