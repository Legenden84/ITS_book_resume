# 3.1 Password Authentication: Summary

## Basic Concept
Password authentication is a basic user verification method where each user has a unique account identified by a username or user ID. To access their account, users must input their username and password. The system checks if the entered password matches the stored password for that user ID. However, even a correct password doesn't guarantee the user is the authorized individual; it only indicates knowledge of the password. Passwords are considered a weak form of authentication, yet they are still widely used.

## Storing Passwords: Hashes vs. Cleartext
To validate user credentials, systems store password information in a password file `F`. Storing passwords in cleartext is risky as it exposes them if `F` is compromised. A safer practice is to store password hashes `(userid, H(pi))`, where `H` is a one-way hash function. The system hashes the entered password and checks for a match with the stored hash.

## Password Attacks
- **Pre-Computed Dictionary Attack**: This attack involves creating a list of potential passwords, hashing them, and comparing them to stolen password hashes to find matches.
  - *Targeted Attack*: Focuses on specific users.
  - *Trawling Attack*: Aims to break into any account, affecting many users.
- **Approaches to Defeat Password Authentication**: Include online and offline password guessing, password capture attacks, and exploiting software vulnerabilities to bypass password interfaces.

## Password Strength and Policies
Systems often impose password composition policies to increase password strength and resilience against simple guessing attacks. However, these policies donâ€™t protect against password capture attacks and can create usability challenges.

## Usability and Security Challenges
- Users struggle with managing numerous passwords, complex composition rules, the need for frequent changes, and understanding the security implications of their password choices.
- Security issues include vulnerability to offline and online guessing attacks and password capture.

## Advantages of Passwords
Despite their disadvantages, passwords are prevalent due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and the absence of physical hardware requirements. They offer quick login, easy recovery, and are well-understood by users. Passwords have maintained their dominance in user authentication, benefitting from their historical position and the inertia in the system.

In summary, while passwords have notable disadvantages in terms of security and usability, their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and the inertia of existing systems have helped maintain their widespread use for user authentication.
