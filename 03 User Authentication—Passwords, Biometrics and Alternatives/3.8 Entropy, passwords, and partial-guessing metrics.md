# 3.8 Entropy, Passwords, and Partial-Guessing Metrics

## Introduction
This section delves into the concepts of Shannon entropy, guessing entropy, and partial-guessing metrics, shedding light on their roles in understanding password vulnerability to guessing attacks. It emphasizes correcting historical misconceptions about entropy to foster accurate models and conclusions regarding password security.

## Example: Data, Information Representation, and Entropy
A 16-bit word example is used to illustrate how information can be redundantly represented, highlighting the difference between physical representation and entropy. The discussion shifts towards password distributions, providing a concrete and relevant context.

## Shannon Entropy
Shannon entropy is introduced with a formal definition, using a password context. The concept is explained as a measure of average uncertainty in a set of outcomes, providing the minimum number of bits needed on average to represent an event from a probability distribution. 

## Interpretation of Entropy
The document provides insight into understanding Shannon entropy through the lens of information conveyed by events, correlating less probable outcomes with higher information content.

## Entropy Properties
Three fundamental properties of entropy are outlined: its non-negativity, its upper bound related to the size of the event space, and its behavior with respect to the equalization of event probabilities. Examples involving dice rolls are used to illustrate these concepts.

## Single Most-Probable Event
The concept of an "optimal attacker" is introduced, focusing on the strategy of guessing the most probable password first. This leads to the discussion of min-entropy and its relevance in measuring vulnerability against single-guess attacks.

## Guesswork (Guessing Function)
Guesswork is presented as a function measuring the average number of attempts needed to correctly guess a password, under optimal guessing order. The document highlights its relevance for attacks aimed at uncovering all passwords in a dataset and notes the skewing effect of difficult passwords on this metric.

## Utility of Entropy and Guesswork
The section critiques the practicality of entropy and guesswork metrics for user-chosen passwords. It underscores their tendency to mislead due to inherent assumptions of exhaustive search and uniform probability distributions, which do not align with real-world password choice behaviors and attack strategies.

## Metrics Useful in Practice
The document shifts to discuss metrics that are more applicable in real-world scenarios. While acknowledging the utility of Shannon entropy in contexts involving random keys, it points out its inadequacy for user-chosen passwords and advocates for partial-guessing metrics.

## Cumulative Probability
Cumulative probability is introduced as a partial-guessing metric, providing a straightforward way to calculate the success rate of an attacker given a fixed number of guessing attempts.

## Guess Count
Guess count is presented as another partial-guessing metric, this time focusing on determining the number of guesses required to achieve a certain success rate across accounts.

## Conclusion
The section underscores the importance of using appropriate metrics and understanding their limitations, advocating for a shift from traditional entropy and guesswork measures to partial-guessing metrics for a more accurate representation of password security in the context of real-world attacks.
