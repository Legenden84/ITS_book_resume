# 5.9 Relating Subjects, Processes, and Protection Domains

## Introduction
In this section, we delve into the intricate relationships between subjects, processes, and protection domains, drawing on the concepts of protection rings. We refine the definitions of subjects and domains, exploring how they interact within the framework of an access control system.

## Refining Subjects and Domains
A **subject** is defined as a tuple S = (P, D), where P is a process executing on behalf of the subject, and D is the domain. The **domain** of a process encompasses the permission set associated with the objects a process can access, which can change over time. For example, a Unix process executing a root-owned setuid program retains its PID but temporarily operates with different privileges. The domain can be visualized as a room where the accessible objects change as the subject moves between rooms. Using Multics’ ring system, a more precise definition of a domain D is given as D = (r, T), with r being the execution ring and T being the process’s descriptor segment table.

## Observations and Notes
1. Changing the execution ring results in a change in the domain and the associated privileges of a subject.
2. A transfer of control within the same ring and process does not alter the domain or the subject.
3. Access brackets define permitted domain changes, enforced by gatekeepers.
4. Virtual address translation imposes constraints on the physical memory accessible by a domain.
5. A system with n protection rings establishes n distinct protection domains, each associated with a process and its fixed descriptor segment, resulting in a set of subjects.
6. C-lists, which define a process’s environment, can be equated with domains, allowing for substitution in the definition of a subject.

## Hardware-Supported CPU Modes and Software Utilization
Despite many computers supporting multiple CPU modes, operating systems often utilize only two (supervisor and user) due to market share considerations. To reach the widest audience, OS vendors opt for compatibility with the lowest-functionality hardware, resulting in underutilized hardware capabilities. While operating systems tailored for specific hardware can offer more features, they face compatibility issues with fewer hardware platforms.

## Summary
This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the relationships between subjects, processes, and protection domains, offering precise definitions and insightful observations. It also highlights the market-driven compromises that result in underutilized hardware capabilities, underscoring the complexity of balancing system functionality and compatibility.
