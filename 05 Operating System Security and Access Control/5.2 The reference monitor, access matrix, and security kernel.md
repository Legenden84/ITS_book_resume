# 5.2 The reference monitor, access matrix, and security kernel Summary

## Access Matrix
The access matrix is a foundational model in computer security, serving as a framework for defining the permissible interactions between subjects and objects within a system. Subjects, which can be users or processes, are entities that require access to system resources. Objects are the resources themselves, such as files, directories, or hardware components. The matrix maps out what actions subjects are allowed to take upon objects, with entries specifying permissions like read, write, or execute. This relationship is denoted as `A(i, j) = z`, indicating that subject `i` has permission `z` to object `j`. The matrix thus acts as a comprehensive table of access permissions, delineating the security policy for every possible subject-object pair.

## Reference Monitor Implementation
To enforce the access matrix policies, the reference monitor operates as an intermediary for all interactions between subjects and objects. It ensures that every access attempt is checked against the matrix to verify permissions. This mechanism is not just a single entity but a collection of monitors, each responsible for different classes of objects. The validation process involves the monitor intercepting the access request and consulting the matrix to either grant or deny the permission based on predefined rules.

## Requirements
For the reference monitor concept to function effectively, it must be tamper-proof, ensuring its integrity against unauthorized changes. It must also be always active and non-bypassable to ensure that no access can occur without its mediation. Lastly, it must be verifiable; the monitor's mechanisms should be simple enough to be fully tested and analyzed for security assurance. Despite these stringent requirements, such a robust security kernel is rare in practice due to the complexity and monolithic nature of most mainstream operating systems.

## Reference Monitor Dependencies
The efficacy of the reference monitor is contingent on several factors:
- A reliable authentication system to accurately identify legitimate subjects.
- Properly functioning hardware and physical security to protect system components.
- Secure communication paths for I/O operations.
- Trust in the entire manufacturing chain, including software and hardware production environments and personnel.

## Access Matrix as a Model Only
While the access matrix is an elegant model, its direct implementation is often impractical due to efficiency concerns. Instead, access permissions are typically managed using lists:

### Capability Lists (C-Lists)
Capability Lists are tailored access permissions for subjects (users or processes) in a system, akin to a key ring holding various keys for different resources. Each C-list entry specifies the actions a subject can perform on different objects. For instance, a C-list might contain `(File123, RW)`, indicating read and write access to `File123`.

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Access Control Lists assign permissions to objects (like files), defining which subjects have access and their permissible actions. An ACL for `File123` might list `[(Alice, R), (Bob, RW), (Charlie, W)]`, showing access levels for Alice, Bob, and Charlie specifically for `File123`.

### Capabilities vs. ID-Based Protection
Capabilities act like access tokens that grant rights based on possession, not subject identity. A subject with a valid capability can access the associated object. ID-Based Protection, in contrast, checks subject identities against a list of authorized users before granting access. While capabilities offer flexibility and are easy to transfer, ID-based systems are preferable for accountability and security based on known identities.


## Basis for Audit Trails
The reference monitor's function of mediating and logging every access attempt forms the foundation for creating detailed audit trails. These logs are critical for troubleshooting, ensuring accountability, and aiding in intrusion detection and forensic analysis. The necessity for audit records to be tamper-proof depends on their specific application and the security requirements of the system.
