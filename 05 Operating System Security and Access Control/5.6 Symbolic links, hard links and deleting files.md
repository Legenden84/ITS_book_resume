# 5.6 Symbolic links, hard links, and deleting files: A Concise Analysis

## File Links and Security Considerations
Unix systems allow a non-directory file to appear across different directories, possibly under various names, through the creation of links using the `ln` command. These links are categorized into symbolic (symlinks) or hard links, each with distinct characteristics and implications for file management and security.

### Hard Links
Creating a hard link, e.g., `ln existing new1`, results in a new directory entry named `new1`, pointing directly to the inode of the existing file. This means both `existing` and `new1` share the same inode, and hence, any changes to the file content reflect in both. The file's name is not stored in the file itself, allowing for different names in directory entries to point to the same inode. However, hardlinking directories is generally discouraged or restricted due to potential complications like directory loops.

### Symbolic Links
Symbolic links, created with the `-s` option as in `ln -s existing new2`, generate a new inode of type symlink, with a datablock storing the pathname of the `existing` file. Accessing `new2` redirects to `existing`, but if `existing` is renamed, moved, or deleted, `new2` breaks, exhibiting a key difference from hard links. 

### Deleting Files and Links
Deleting a file involves removing its filename from a directory listing, but the inode and datablock are only purged from the filesystem if the fileâ€™s link count drops to zero, i.e., no directory entries point to that inode anymore. Deleting a symlink only removes the symlink itself, leaving the target file intact. In contrast, deleting a hardlink reduces the link count, and the file content is retained until the last hardlink is removed. This system design underscores the independence of inodes from specific directories, with directory entries serving as an organizational structure.
