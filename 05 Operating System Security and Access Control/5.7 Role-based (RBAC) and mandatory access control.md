# 5.7 Role-based (RBAC) and Mandatory Access Control: An Overview

## Access Control Mechanisms in Operating Systems

### Discretionary Access Control (D-AC)
D-AC systems, like Unix-style file permissions, place the power of granting permissions in the hands of the resource owner. The owner decides the level of access granted to others for that particular resource. Multics and Unix serve as classic examples of such systems.

### Mandatory Access Control (M-AC)
In contrast to D-AC, M-AC systems centralize permission decisions, assigning the responsibility to a security policy administrator. Every object (resource) has predefined access permissions for each subject (user or process). The U.S. government’s multi-level security (MLS) model is a specific type of M-AC where users are given security clearance levels, and documents are classified accordingly. Access is contingent on the user’s clearance being equal to or higher than the document’s classification. The U.S. government’s clearance levels include Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Controlled Unclassified, and Unclassified.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC represents a middle ground between D-AC and M-AC, drawing on elements from both. Instead of tying permissions directly to individual user identities, RBAC assigns roles to users, with each role carrying a specific set of permissions. This mirrors the way larger organizations typically delegate responsibilities and access.

### Example of RBAC in Action
Suppose a role `GradAdmin` grants read and write access to certain department files, and `GrantManager` grants read access to grant-related files. A staff member, Alex, assigned both roles, will inherit all these permissions. When Alex moves departments and Corey takes over, assigning these roles to Corey ensures a seamless transition of permissions. This efficiency is a stark contrast to the cumbersome process of reassigning permissions on an individual basis, showcasing RBAC’s practicality in organizational settings.

Roles can also be hierarchically structured, allowing for nuanced and scalable permission assignment. Senior roles can encapsulate the permissions of their junior counterparts, with additional privileges as necessary.

## Integrating M-AC with Linux: SELinux and Beyond

The last part of the section touches upon SELinux, a security-enhanced Linux version implementing M-AC principles. It is built upon the Flask operating system architecture and supported by the Linux Security Module framework, which accommodates various M-AC approaches within the Linux environment. Further, SEAndroid extends SELinux capabilities to the Google Android OS, highlighting the adaptability and relevance of M-AC systems in contemporary technology ecosystems.
