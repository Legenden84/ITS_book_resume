# Chapter 5: Operating System Security and Access Control Summary

In Chapter 5, the evolution of operating system (OS) security from the 1950s through the 1970s is discussed, highlighting the emergence of mass-produced computers, the advent of time-sharing systems in the 1960s, and the golden design age of OS protection mechanisms from 1965 to 1975. Despite a simpler threat environment characterized by the lack of computer networks and fewer software authors and programs, many of the security challenges faced during this period are still relevant today. These challenges include maintaining process separation while enabling resource sharing, protecting programs from each other on the same machine, and restricting access to resources.

The concept of "protection" during this time largely revolved around controlling access to memory locations. Given that both data and programs are stored in memory, and that input/output devices and communications channels are accessed through memory addresses and files, control over memory access translates to a broad-based approach to access control for objects and devices.

Protection mechanisms initially focused on limiting the memory addresses that processes could access, working in conjunction with early virtual memory address translation techniques. Access control lists were also developed to facilitate resource sharing. These elements continue to be fundamental to OS protection.

The chapter emphasizes learning about these protection mechanisms in operating systems as a foundational step towards understanding computer security. While not aiming to provide exhaustive details on all major operating systems, the chapter draws attention to the features of a few specific systems, particularly Unix and Multics, to highlight core principles and expose crucial issues in system design.

Unix, with its many variants and relatives including Linux, is presented as a prime example due to its widespread use and diverse applications. Multics, on the other hand, is highlighted for its early incorporation of security features and its profound influence on subsequent systems. The security-related aspects of Multics were integral from its initial design phases in the mid-1960s through to its commercial availability. The system is noted for its careful engineering and the richness of its technical literature, which provides detailed insights into both its motivations and design, making it an invaluable resource for learning about OS security.
