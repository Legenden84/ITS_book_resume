# 5.8 Protection Rings: Isolation Meets Finer-Grained Sharing

## Overview
Protection rings serve as a practical solution to balance the needs for security through isolation and the convenience of shared objects, enhancing the (supervisor, user mode) hardware model to incorporate multiple privilege levels and domains. They exemplify principles such as COMPLETE MEDIATION, ISOLATED COMPARTMENTS, and MODULAR DESIGN.

## Understanding Protection Rings
Introduced in the mid-1960s by Multics with hardware support for eight rings, protection rings extend the idea of isolation and selective sharing to within processes. This enables separation akin to supervisor-user separation, alongside controlled sharing of protected subsystems and varying degrees of separation.

## Ring Numbers and Support
Rings are numbered from 0 (most privileged) to n-1 (least privileged), forming a nested and ordered set. Each segment descriptor and the CPU Program Counter are assigned a ring number, enhancing access control mechanisms. Access to different rings is controlled, and stronger rings are protected from access by weaker rings, with flexibility allowed through authorization.

## Procedure Segment Access Brackets and Gate Extensions
Access brackets (n1, n2) define which rings can access a segment, with additional checks required for cross-ring transfers. In cases where a process in a weaker ring attempts to access a stronger ring, a fault is triggered, requiring supervisor intervention. Gate extensions (n1, n2, n3) provide flexibility, allowing pre-specified entry points for certain cross-ring transfers, mediated by gatekeeper software.

## Ring Gatekeeper Mediation and Cross-Ring Returns
When a process requests a transfer to a procedure segment in another ring, mediation occurs to ensure security and consistency. Returns from cross-ring transfers are likewise mediated, with return gates ensuring that returns match stack expectations.

## Ring Number Assignment After Outside-Bracket Transfers
When transferring from outside a bracket, the assignment of the ring number (PCring-num) for the executing process is guided by the principles of least privilege and simplicity, considering the potential need for temporary privilege escalation or reduction.

## Execute, Read, and Write Brackets
In addition to execute brackets, read and write access brackets define permissions for accessing segments. These brackets are set with consideration for simplicity and security, ensuring comprehensive rules for RWX access to segments.

## Alternate Bracket Ruleset for Data Segments
An alternate ruleset for data segments provides additional flexibility and control, ensuring that processes in different rings have appropriate access to data, with rules that prevent simultaneous read and write access.

## Segment Descriptors and Access Control
Segment descriptors, central to Multics' access control mechanism, are derived from access control entries specifying permissions for subjects (users/processes) on objects (memory segments). The creation of these descriptors is a critical part of setting up a user's virtual memory space upon login, with considerations for efficiency and security.

## Exercises and Further Discussion
Exercises and discussions further explore the practical aspects of implementing these protection mechanisms, particularly in the context of supervisor tasks and access control management.
