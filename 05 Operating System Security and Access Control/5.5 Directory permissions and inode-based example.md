# 5.5 Directory permissions and inode-based example

## Overview
This section delves into the nuances of directory permissions in Unix filesystems, contrasting them with regular file permissions, and providing an in-depth example based on inode structures.

### Unix Directory Structure
Unix filesystems are organized as a rooted tree, with the root named “/”. Here, regular files are leaf nodes, while directories (dirfiles) are interior nodes. Both utilize inodes for metadata storage and a datablock for content. A dirfile's datablock includes information about its child entries, structured as `(d-name, d-inode)` pairs. The first two entries in any directory are always “.” (the directory itself) and “..” (its parent).

### Directory Permissions (LAT bits)
In Unix, directory files have permissions that differ significantly from regular files, encapsulated by the LAT (List, Alter, Traverse) bits:

- **L (List)**: Allows viewing filenames within the directory, not their content or metadata.
- **A (Alter)**: Permits editing directory content, but requires Traverse permission as well. This includes renaming, deleting, or adding new entries.
- **T (Traverse)**: Enables navigating through the directory, setting it as the working directory, and accessing metadata of its files. 

Special bits include:
- **setuid**: Generally meaningless for directories.
- **setgid**: Causes new files/directories within to inherit the directory’s GID, facilitating group file sharing.
- **t-bit (sticky bit)**: Prevents deletion/renaming of files owned by others, ensuring only the owner and root can delete files.

### Sticky Bit and World-Writable Files
The sticky bit is crucial for world-writable directories like `/tmp`, preventing malicious file replacement. World-writable files, marked by `w` in permissions, should be used cautiously, especially for critical startup or system files.

### Inode Example: Creating a Directory
When creating a new directory (e.g., `mkdir /NBAwest/Warriors`), several OS actions occur:

1. **Inode Creation**: A new inode instance for “Warriors” is created, flagged as a directory, and initially linked to a null datalink.
2. **Datablock Creation**: A new datablock with two entries (`.` and `..`) is created and linked to the “Warriors” inode.
3. **Parent Directory Update**: The (“Warriors”, inode) entry is added to the parent directory's datablock.
4. **Linking**: System calls to `link()` fix the null pointers, establishing correct links for `.` and `..` in the “Warriors” datablock.

This example demonstrates how directory and file creation affects the inode and datablock structures, illustrating the role of permissions in these processes.

### Unexpected Detail and Initial Values
Interestingly, a file's name appears only in its parent’s directory entry, allowing different parents to refer to the same file with different names. When a new directory is created, its initial permission bits are assigned, commonly resulting in a `755` permission set (RWX for user, RX for group and others).

### Directory Listings and Access Control
Using `ls -l`, users can list directory contents with detailed permissions information. The command `ls -ld` provides metadata for the directory itself. 

### Exercise: Access Control Outside Filesystem
Considering backup scenarios, the exercise prompts contemplation on whether custom software tools interacting with filesystem data from secondary storage are bound by the inode permission bits. It encourages critical thinking about access control mechanisms beyond the filesystem layer.
