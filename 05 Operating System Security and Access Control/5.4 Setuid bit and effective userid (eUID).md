## 5.4 Setuid bit and effective userid (eUID)

### SETUID BIT

- **Functionality**: The setuid bit, a special permission bit, allows a process running a binary executable file to temporarily assume the file owner's userid, enhancing access to resources the original process may lack privileges for.
- **Usage and Implications**: Predominantly used for security-critical system resources, the setuid bit ensures that enhanced access is granted under the constraint of a carefully designed and trustworthy program. However, this makes such programs attractive targets for attackers, especially if the file owner is root.

### REAL USERID, EFFECTIVE USERID, AND SAVED USERID

- **Three Userid Values**: Unix systems track three userid values for processes: real userid (rUID) denoting the owner, effective userid (eUID) for determining privileges, and saved userid (sUID) to toggle between rUID and eUID.
- **Privilege Determination and System Calls**: Access privileges are determined by eUID, which also sets the file owner for newly created files. System calls like `getuid()`, `geteuid()`, and others aid in retrieving or setting these userid values.
- **Selective Privilege Dropping**: The ability to switch between eUID and rUID allows for selective privilege dropping, adhering to the least-privilege principle, ensuring higher privileges are active only when necessary.

### SETGID PERMISSION BIT

- **Analogy to SETUID**: The setgid bit is analogous to setuid but operates on a file’s protection group. It involves group userid values rGID, eGID, sGID and their corresponding system calls.

### INHERITING USERIDS

- **Process Creation and Forking**: Unix creates processes via the `fork()` syscall, where the child process inherits the parent's userids but gets a new PID. Upon executing a separate executable, the child also inherits these userids, unless the executable is setuid.
- **Example with Login**: Using the Unix `login` command as an example, the process sets its UID and GID based on the user’s password file entry, illustrating the inheritance of userids.

### DISPLAYING SETUID AND SETGID BITS

- **10-Character Notation**: Setuid and setgid bits are visible in the file’s permission display, transforming the user or group execute letter: `x` to `s` or `-` to `S`. The capital `S` indicates a non-executable file with setuid/setgid, which is not practical.

### Conclusion

This section thoroughly examines the setuid bit and its implications for access privileges, detailing its operation, associated risks, and its place within the Unix permission system. It also elaborates on the real, effective, and saved userid values, illustrating their roles and usage in privilege management, along with a comprehensive explanation of the setgid bit and process userid inheritance.
