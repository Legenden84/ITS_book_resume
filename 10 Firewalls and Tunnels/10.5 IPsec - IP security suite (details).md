# 10.5 IPsec: IP Security Suite

## Overview of IPsec

The IP Security suite, or IPsec, presents itself as a paramount solution in the realm of network-layer security. This protocol suite is meticulously designed to automatically extend its security services to all operating transport and application layer protocols. In stark contrast to the Internet Protocol (IP), which is devoid of built-in security functionalities such as encryption and authentication, IPsec stands out as a beacon of security. It is crucial to note that while TLS secures application-layer protocols when they opt to utilize its services, and SSH client software can create secure tunnels for other application protocols, IPsec operates at a different layer to provide inherent security services.

## The Core Protocols of IPsec

IPsec enhances network security through a comprehensive suite of security services, delivered diligently by three core protocols:

### 1. IKE: Internet Key Exchange
IKE plays a pivotal role in IPsec’s operation, automating the key establishment process with the sophisticated use of Diffie-Hellman. This protocol ensures that before any data transfer occurs, there is a robust parameter negotiation phase, which is instrumental in setting up the intricate details of the communication protocol between endpoints. This phase culminates in the establishment of a shared state, encapsulating agreed-upon algorithms, sequence numbers, and cryptographic keys, all of which collectively define a Security Association (SA). It is crucial to understand that SAs are unidirectional, necessitating a separate SA for each direction of communication. These SAs are uniquely identified through an SPI (Security Parameters Index), and IPsec headers carry this SPI, ensuring a seamless operation.

### 2. AH: Authentication Header
The AH protocol stands as a bastion of data origin authentication, ensuring the integrity of the entire IPsec payload and selected fields within the IP header – specifically, those fields that remain constant during transit. Fields that are subject to alteration en route are meticulously zeroed out during the MAC computation process. In addition to this, AH offers optional replay protection, utilizing the AH sequence number field in conjunction with stored SA data identified by the SPI.

### 3. ESP: Encapsulating Security Payload
ESP takes the security services a notch higher, offering encryption of the IPsec payload, and akin to AH, it provides data origin authentication, integrity verification, and optional replay protection. However, a key differentiator is that in ESP’s case, the MAC computation does not encompass any IP header fields.

## IPsec Operational Modes

IPsec flexes its versatility through its ability to operate in two distinct modes:

### 1. Transport Mode
In this mode, IPsec provides an end-to-end VPN, connecting one host to another directly. The IPsec header is strategically inserted between the original IP header and payload, ensuring the transportation (but not tunneling) of the original IP header. This mode, however, has its limitations, especially when one of the endpoints is a network, as it results in the availability of only one IP header for delivery.

### 2. Tunnel Mode
Tunnel mode expands IPsec’s use cases to include network-to-network and host-to-network VPNs. For network-to-network VPNs, security is applied up to the enterprise network gateways, but not end-to-end. For host-to-network VPNs, in-host network gateway functionality is built into the remote host’s software. In both cases, the entire original IP datagram is encapsulated, creating an IP-in-IP tunnel.

## Challenges and Deployment of IPsec

IPsec’s extensive configuration options, while providing great flexibility, also render it a “heavyweight” protocol suite. This complexity necessitates the presence of a dedicated expert for managing IPsec VPNs. Deployment strategies to integrate IPsec into the network stack include OS kernel build-in, bump in the stack, and bump in the wire methods. This level of integration complexity stands in contrast to the simpler end-user applications like SSH or TLS, highlighting why IPsec is often considered heavyweight.

## Managing Security with IPsec Policies

The establishment of an IPsec VPN does not automatically mean that all traffic to a VPN peer traverses the VPN. Instead, datagrams must conform to specific policy rules defined in the IPsec security policy database. These rules facilitate policy-based packet filtering, ensuring that only traffic meeting certain criteria is secured by the VPN.

## Configurations in ESP

ESP presents a variety of configurations, ranging from an authenticate-only mode (utilizing null encryption), to an encrypt-only mode (which is generally discouraged due to security vulnerabilities), and configurations that combine ESP protection followed by AH. Given that ESP provides all functionalities of AH except for authenticating some outer IP header fields, many VPN configurations opt to use ESP without AH for a streamlined security approach.
