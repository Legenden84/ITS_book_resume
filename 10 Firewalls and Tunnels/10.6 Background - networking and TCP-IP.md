# 10.6 Background: Networking and TCP/IP

## IP and Addresses
The Internet Protocol (IP) is fundamental in the TCP/IP suite, specifically designed for packet-switched networks. The network stack framework, illustrated in Figure 10.10, underpins network communications software. IP addresses serve as logical identifiers for interfaces, guiding data to its destination on an IP host device. These addresses are crucial for routing, pinpointing a host’s current network location rather than its physical presence. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit entities, presented in dot-separated 8-bit groups, whereas IPv6 addresses expand to 128 bits. On the link layer (e.g., LANs), physical addresses serve to identify hosts for data frame delivery. IP addresses are mapped to these physical MAC addresses via the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which operates locally within a LAN, unable to cross routers.

## Datagrams and Packets
Packet-switched networks operate by transferring data through hops between network devices like routers. Data travel in datagrams, comprising a header for delivery assistance and a payload carrying the intended data. Datagram size can be up to 65,535 bytes, as indicated by a 16-bit length field. However, physical networks on each hop have a size limit for data delivery units, termed packets, defined by the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). Datagrams larger than an MTU are fragmented to fit within data frames, with a fragment offset header field guiding reassembly. Consequently, while not all datagrams travel as single packets, each packet represents an independently deliverable datagram, possibly a fragment of a larger datagram.

## TCP and UDP
TCP/IP’s network layer utilizes IP datagrams to transmit TCP, UDP, and ICMP data. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate at the transport layer, offering different methods of data transfer between hosts. UDP is ‘connectionless’, providing one-way datagram delivery without maintaining state, guaranteeing delivery, or removing duplicates. In contrast, TCP is ‘connection-oriented’, ensuring reliable two-way byte flows, delivering data in order, and terminating connections with error messages if delivery guarantees aren’t met. TCP segments, the payload of IP datagrams, carry application protocol data (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

## Ports and Sockets
Ports enable servers to offer multiple services, directing data units to the right application. Port numbers are 16-bit entities, with specific ranges reserved for well-known network protocols (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, DNS) and others for unprivileged use. Clients use short-lived ports, primarily in the 1024-5000 range, for TCP connections, leaving higher numbered ports for less common services. An <IP address, port number> pairing defines an IP socket, which software accesses via file descriptors. TCP connections link source and destination sockets. Despite also using ports, UDP, being connectionless, only utilizes destination sockets.

## TCP Header, Connection Set-Up
The TCP header, detailed in Figure 10.15, includes flag bits vital for connection management. Establishing a TCP connection requires a three-way handshake: a SYN message from the client, a SYN-ACK response from the server, and an ACK from the client. Once established, the ACK flag stays set, helping firewalls to differentiate and potentially deny inbound TCP connection requests. Connection termination can occur orderly through a FIN (finish) bit exchange or abruptly with a reset flag (RST). The RST, or abortive release, instantly terminates a connection.

## ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
ICMP, a network-layer protocol like IP, sends error, diagnostic, and control messages between hosts, often routers. ICMP messages follow the IP header in an IP datagram and start with a 32-bit word defining their type, code, and checksum, but lack source or destination ports. Examples include echo requests (used by ping for connectivity tests), destination unreachable, and time exceeded messages. Firewalls often filter ICMP messages based on their type and code fields, managing network security and connectivity.
