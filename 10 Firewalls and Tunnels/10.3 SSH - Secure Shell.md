# 10.3 SSH: Secure Shell

## Introduction
IP, the cornerstone of internet communication, lacks inherent security, leading to potential false assumptions about data protection by higher-level protocols. A practical solution is embedding generic security services in lower communication layers, an approach exemplified by SSH (Secure Shell). Introduced in 1995, SSH has gained global acceptance. Despite its name, SSH does not provide a shell itself but facilitates secure access to a shell and other programs through an encrypted tunnel.

## SSH Overview
SSH emerged as a secure alternative to then-existing remote login and file transfer protocols (e.g., rlogin, telnet, ftp), which transmitted data and passwords in cleartext. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, utilizing TCP for reliable packet transport and creating a security tunnel for protected data transmission. Notably, SSH supports the secure operation of any program available on a remote host.

## Remote Shell via SSH
SSH enables users to access a remote shell securely, providing a terminal interface and command prompt on the remote machine. It utilizes standard communication streams and operates in conjunction with SSH daemon (sshd) and client software (ssh), obviating the need for remote applications to be SSH-aware.

## Three Protocols Composing SSH
SSH comprises three main components:
1. **Transport Layer Protocol**: Provides server authentication, encryption, and integrity protection, alongside cryptographic negotiations.
2. **User Authentication Protocol**: Manages client-to-server authentication, depending on the transport layer for security.
3. **Connection Protocol**: Facilitates multiple uses of a single SSH connection, allowing multiplexed data transfer across various logical channels.

## SSH Client Authentication
SSH servers offer multiple client authentication methods, commonly including password, Kerberos ticket, and client public key. For public key authentication, the server verifies the client’s public key and signature, ensuring that the key is pre-registered and the signature is valid.

## SSH Server Authentication: Establishing Trust in Host Key
This process is crucial for preventing middle-person attacks and ensuring a secure connection. Clients must trust the server’s public key, which can be achieved through manual verification or enterprise-level automated methods.

## Trust Models for SSH Host Keys
Two primary models exist:
1. **Client Database of SSH Server Keys**: Clients store and trust server keys after initial connection and manual approval.
2. **CA-Certified SSH Server Keys**: A more automated approach, resembling the TLS CA/browser trust model, but potentially less global and more controlled.

## SSH User Authentication (Method Confusion)
Client-side storage of private keys, protected by passphrases or passwords, can lead to user confusion regarding the authentication method in use, particularly in cases of public key authentication.

## SSH Port Forwarding
SSH supports secure data redirection for legacy applications through SSH tunnels, enhancing security for otherwise unprotected TCP/IP communications.

## How SCP Works
Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) facilitates secure file transfers between hosts, utilizing SSH for encrypted data transmission and command execution.

## SSH X11 Forwarding
SSH also supports secure forwarding for X11 connections, enabling remote graphical user interfaces to be displayed and interacted with on a local machine.

## "Trusted" Login Hosts: Mechanism and Dangers
Historically, certain Unix tools allowed password-free remote access from trusted hosts. This practice is now discouraged due to its inherent security risks, including potential for cascading trust exploitation, as demonstrated by the Morris worm incident.

## Port 22 for SSH
Port 22 was strategically chosen for SSH, nestled between the ports for telnet and FTP, marking a transition towards more secure remote access methods.
